</div>


<p>The next day Lord Tony’s only sister,
Lady Rachel Jenkins, arrived to call—but
not for the first time—upon Miss West.
She was an extremely vivacious and
agreeable little woman, with dark eyes
and flashing teeth. She took Madeline
out with her in her own brougham, and—oh,
great favour!—introduced her to her
pet dressmaker. This august person
viewed Miss West’s stone-coloured costume
with an air of amused contempt;
it was not good style; the cut of the skirt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
was quite “out,” and she finally wound
up by uttering the awful words, “Ready
made.” It was not what Madeline liked,
or even thought she would like, but what
Lady Rachel suggested and Madame
Coralie approved, that was selected.</p>

<p>“Your father, my dear,” patting the
girl’s hand confidentially, “met me on the
stairs, and we had a few words together.
I’m going to show you what we do in
London, and what we wear, and whom
we know; and what we don’t wear, and
whom we don’t know, my little country
mouse!”</p>

<p>So the country mouse was endowed
with half a dozen fine dresses chosen
entirely by Lady Rachel—dresses for
morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>

<p>“I only order six, my dear,” said her
chaperon cheerily, “as the season is
getting over, and these will carry you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
on till August, if you have a good maid.
Madame Coralie, we can only give you
five days,” rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>But Madame Coralie threw up eyes
and hands and gesticulated, and volubly
declared that it was <i>absolument impossible</i>!
She had so many gowns for Ascot
and the royal garden party. Nevertheless,
Lady Rachel was imperious, and
carried her point.</p>

<p>“The opera mantle is to be lined with
pink brocade, and you will line the cloth
skirt with shot sulphur-coloured silk; and
that body I chose is to be almost drowned
in chiffon and silver.”</p>

<p>She was to be female bear-leader to
this young heiress, and was resolved
that her appearance should not disgrace
her, and that “the old squatter,” as she
called him, should be taken at his word,
and made to pay and look pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The succeeding visit was to a milliner’s;
the next to a shoe shop, when the same
scene was rehearsed. Madeline looked
on and said nothing, but made an angry
mental note that she would never again
go out shopping with this imperious little
lady. Why, even the poorest had the
privilege of choosing their own clothes!
Why should this little black-browed
woman, barely up to her shoulder, tyrannize
over her thus? Simply because, my
dear, unsophisticated Madeline, she has
promised to bring you out—to be your
social godmother, to introduce you to
society, such as your father loveth, and
to be friendly. Besides all this, she has
already decided in her own mind that
“you will do very well,” and are not
nearly as rustic as she expected; and she
has made up her mind—precisely as she
did about your satin dinner-dress—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
you are to marry her brother. Oh, happy
prospect!</p>

<p>Lady Rachel was Lord Anthony’s only
sister—a woman of five and thirty, who,
thirteen years previously, had married a
rich <i>parvenu</i>—plain, homely, much older
than herself—for his money. She had no
fortune as Lady Rachel Foster, and she
was not particularly pretty; so she made
the best available use of her title, and
changed it for twenty thousand a year
and the name of Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins
liked being announced as “Lady Rachel,
and Mr. Jenkins;” to be asked in a loud
voice, in public places, “How is your
wife—Lady Rachel?” For her part,
she liked her fine house, servants,
carriages, and jewels; and both were, to
a certain extent, satisfied with their bargain.
Perhaps of late years there had
been a certain amount of disappointment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Lady Rachel went more and more into
society, and drifted widely apart from
Mr. Jenkins and his city friends. Mr.
Jenkins was not considered an acquisition
in her circles, which were a little
rapid. He was given to understand—by
deeds, not words—that he was
rather a bore, and that he must not always
be expecting to be tied to the tail of his
brilliant, fashionable, frivolous little wife—and
then, Mr. Jenkins was jealous!</p>

<p>It was quite time that Anthony was
married, thought his sister. He was not
prepossessing in appearance. He was well
known in society, and especially in her
own set, as a fellow with an empty head,
empty pockets, and a roving nature. He
was not popular. She was aware that he
had been rejected by heiress after heiress.
He would not be modest and content
with a plain girl, or an elderly widow, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
even a faded spinster on the shady side
of forty! No; Lord Anthony Foster
must have beauty and money to boot,
and there was no bidding for his coronet
in the quarters these came from. Prudent
mammas had set a mark against his
name, and where his attentions would
have been welcomed, he turned up his
nose, and talked in a high moral manner
about the sin of marrying one’s grandmother.
His affectionate sister had
vainly suggested one or two ladies that
she had thought suitable, but until now
Lord Tony had been too <i>difficile</i>, and
her pains had gone for nothing!</p>

<p>But now, oh, joy at last, he had found
a girl almost, as one might say, to order—young,
accomplished, ladylike, very
pretty, and very rich.</p>

<p>Lady Rachel already considered Madeline
her sister-in-law, and had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
selected her own gown for the wedding,
so far ahead do some active, imaginative
natures throw their mental life. There
was nothing to wait for. Tony was
willing—the old squatter was willing—and
the girl—well, she was willing, of
course.</p>

<p>Madame Coralie’s dresses came home
punctually, and were all that the most
fastidious could desire, in fit, style,
colour, and cut. Madeline spent the
whole afternoon, in the retirement of
her own room, slowly trying on all six,
one after the other, with ever-increasing
approbation. The climax was an oyster-white
satin, with a turquoise velvet and
silver bodice—a dream of a dress, to quote
the enraptured Josephine.</p>

<p>Madeline had an æsthetic appreciation
of herself as she stood before a glass and
contemplated the slim figure, white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
rounded arms, the rich glistening skirt,
the exquisitely moulded bodice. Could
this apparition be the same young
woman who had humbled herself before
Mrs. Kane, and carried up her own coals?
What a difference dress made—in self-respect
and self-importance! Dress, as
she now realized it, was a powerful
engine in cultivating one’s own self-esteem.
Yes, a silk-lined skirt could impart
a surprising amount of confidence!
She glanced over one shoulder, then
over the other, then looked full at her
reflection, and said to herself, with a
smile, “I do love pretty clothes!”</p>

</div>


<p>Lady Rachel and Madame Coralie,
between them, soon metamorphosed the
appearance of Miss West. She took to
her elegant dresses and mantles and tea-gowns
with astonishing facility; also to
her landau and pair, victoria and cobs,
diamonds, dignities, and the last fashion
in dogs—a Chinese spaniel. It was not
a specimen of animal she especially
admired; but her father paid a long
price for Chow-chow, because he was the
rage, and he looked well on the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
seat of the victoria. Yes, Madeline was
remarkably adaptable; she developed a
predilection for all the sensual accessories
of colour and perfume. She also developed
a fastidious taste at table, and
a rare talent for laying out money.</p>

<p>And what of Laurence Wynne during
the time that his wife is revelling in
luxury?</p>

<p>He has been making rapid strides on
the road to recovery; he is almost well;
and the end of his sojourn with the
friendly farmer’s family is now drawing
perceptibly near. He has letters from
Madeline, as she finds means to post
them with her own hands—letters full
of descriptions of her new life, her new
friends, and all the wonderful new world
that has been opened to her view.</p>

<p>She, who was never at a dance, excepting
at the two breaking-up parties at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Mrs. Harper’s, has been living in a round
of gaiety, which has whirled faster and
faster as the season waned—thanks to
Lady Rachel’s introductions and chaperonage;
thanks to her beauty, and her
father’s great wealth.</p>

<p>Miss West has already become known—already
her brilliant colouring and
perfect profile have been noted by great
and competent connoisseurs. Her face
was already familiar in the park.</p>

<p>Luckily for her, dark beauties were
coming into fashion; in every way she was
fortunate. Her carriage was pointed out
in the Row; her table was littered with
big square monogramed envelopes and
cards of invitation, far too numerous for
acceptance. And Miss West, the Australian
heiress as she was called, had
opened many doors by that potent pass-key,
a pretty face, and admitted not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
herself, but also her proud and happy
parent.</p>

<p>Madeline does not say all this in so
many long sentences to Laurence; not
that he would be jealous, dear fellow!
She knows him better than that; but she
is sensible that there is a certain incongruity
between their circumstances just
at present, and she will not enlarge on
her successes more than is absolutely
needful. Yet a word drops out here
and slips in there, which tells Laurence
far more than she supposes. Besides
this, Laurence is no fool. He can draw
inferences; he can put two and two
together—it is his profession. Moreover,
he sees the daily, society, and illustrated
papers, thanks to Mr. Jessop, who
has given a liberal order to his news-agent,
believing that his gifted friend,
who always lived at high brain-pressure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
must be developing into a state of coma
in his rural quarters, among cows and
pigs and geese.</p>

<p>Laurence reads the letters between
the lines. He reads society’s doings,
and in the warm June and July evenings,
as he strolls about the fields alone, has
plenty of leisure for reflection. These
are not very happy times for Laurence
Wynne. He has found some consolation
in work. One or two articles from his
pen have made their way into leading
reviews, and been praised for their style,
substance, and wit. A short sketch of
a country tragedy has added another
feather to his cap. In these long, lonely,
empty days, he had given ample time
and brain-work (his best) to these vivid
articles, readily scanned in a quarter of
an hour. They recalled his name; at
any rate, people began to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Laurence Wynne—a clever chap who
made a foolish marriage, and subsequently
lived in a slum, and then nearly
went and died. Apparently, he was not
dead yet! There was a good deal of
vitality in him still, and that of a very
marketable description. Success, however
small, breeds success, and a little
sun began to shine on Laurence Wynne
at last. He was asked to contribute
articles to the <i>Razor</i> and the <i>Present</i>,
two of the most up-to-date periodicals.
He was well paid—cash down. He was
independent once more, and he felt as
if he would like to go out into the fields
and shout for joy.</p>

<p>Now and then he ventured to write
to his wife—to Miss West, 365, Belgrave
Square; and Miss West eagerly snatches
the letter from under a pile of society
notes, in thick fashionable envelopes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
plunges it into her pocket, and reads it
greedily alone; for although she is a
little bit carried away by admiration,
money, and power, yet a letter from
Laurence puts all these pleasures completely
into the shade, as yet.</p>

<p>This is his last that she holds in her
hand, written after long meditation, and
with many a pause between the sentences.
He had turned out an article for the
<i>Razor</i> in half the time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

“Holt Hill Farm.”<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Madeline</span>,”</p>

<p>“Your welcome letter is at
present lying before me; and now that
the household is asleep, and that there
is not a stir on the premises, nor a sound,
except the loud ticking of the kitchen
clock, I sit down to write to you without
fear of being disturbed, for this, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Maddie, is going to be an important
epistle. I am sincerely glad to hear that
you are so happy; that your father
shows that he has affection for you; that
you and he are no longer strangers, but
getting on together capitally. I hope
his tenderness will be able to survive
the news you have to tell him, and must
tell him soon—the fact, in short, that
you are married. I can quite understand
how you are dreading the evil moment,
and can fully enter into your feelings
of shrinking reluctance to dispel this
beautiful new life, this kind of enchanted
existence, by just one magic word, and
that word to be uttered by your own
lips. But if you are adverse to mentioning
this one word—which must be
spoken, sooner or later—let me take the
commission on myself. I will speak to
your father. I will bear the full blast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and fury of his indignation and disappointment.
After all, we have nothing
to be ashamed of. If I had known that
you were the heiress of a millionaire,
I would never have ventured to marry
you—of that you may be sure. But,
under other circumstances, it was different.
In the days when you had
neither father nor home, I offered you
my home, such as it was. There was no
disparity between our two walks in life,
nothing to indicate the barrier which has
subsequently arisen between us.</p>

<p>“Maddie, we have come to the cross-roads.
You will have to choose one way
or the other. You will have to choose
between your father and me—between
riches and poverty. If your father will
not listen to the idea of your having
changed your name, you must let me
testify to the fact; and if he shuts his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
doors on you afterwards, you are no
worse off than a year ago. If I thought
you would ever again have such a terrible
struggle to live as you experienced last
winter, I would not be so barbarous, so
cruel, as to ask you to leave your present
luxurious home. But things look brighter.
I am, thank God, restored to health. I
have a prospect of earning a livelihood;
our dark days are, I trust, a thing of the
past. I am resolved to set to work next
week. I cannot endure the idea of living
in idleness on your father’s money; for
although the whole of our stay here has
cost less than you say he has recently
given for a dog, still it <i>is</i> his money all
the same—money for your education,
money diverted from its original use,
money expended on a fraud. Of late I
have not touched it, having another resource.
I only wish I could replace every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
halfpenny. Let us have an end of this
secrecy and double-dealing. And now
that we have once more got a foothold
on life, and the means of existence, I
believe I shall be able to scramble up the
ladder! Who knows but you may be a
judge’s wife yet! I wish I could give
you even a tithe of the luxuries with
which you are now surrounded. I would
pawn years of my future to do it. But
if I cannot endow you with diamonds and
carriages, I can give you what money
cannot buy, Maddie, an undivided heart,
that loves you with every pulse of its
existence.</p>

<p>“Now I have said my say. I only
await a line from you to go at once to
town, and lay bare our secret to your
father. It is the right thing to do; it
is, indeed. You cannot continue to live
this double life—and your real home is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
with your husband and child. It is now
three months and more since you drove
away down the lane with Farmer Holt—three
long, long months to me, Maddie.
You have had ample time to make an
inroad on your father’s affections. You
can do a great deal in that way in less
than three months. If he is what you say,
he will not be implacable. You are his
only child. You tell me that he thinks
so much of good blood and birth—at
least in this respect the Wynnes should
please him. He will find out all about
us in Burke. We were barons of the
twelfth century; and there is a dormant
title in the family. The candle is just
out, and I must say good-bye. But I
could go on writing to you for another
hour. The text of my discourse, if
not sufficiently plain already, is, let
me tell your father of our marriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
One line will bring me to town at
once.</p>

<p class="right">
“I am, your loving husband,<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">“<span class="smcap">Laurence Wynne</span>.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Do not think that I am complaining
that you have not been down here. I
fully understand that your father, having
no occupation, is much at home, perhaps
<i>too</i> much at home, and can’t bear
you out of his sight—which is natural,
and that to come and go to the Holt
Farm would take four hours—hours for
which you would be called on to account.
And you dared not venture—dared not
deceive him. Deceive him no longer in
<i>any way</i>, Maddie. Send me a wire, and
he shall know all before to-morrow
night.”</p>
</div>

<p>Madeline read this letter over slowly,
with rapidly changing colour. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
sentences she perused two or three times,
and when she came to the last word, she
recommenced at the beginning—then
she folded it up, put it into its envelope,
thrust it into her dressing-case, and
turned the key.</p>

<p>She was a good deal disturbed; you
could read that by her face, as she went
and stood in the window, playing with
the charms on her bangle. She had a
colour in her cheeks and a frown upon
her brow.</p>

<p>How impatient Laurence was! Why
would he not give her time? What was
three months to prepare papa? And was
it <i>really</i> three months? It seemed more
like three weeks. Yes, April; and this
was the beginning of July.</p>

<p>Her eyes slowly travelled round the
luxurious apartment, with its pale blue
silk hangings, inlaid satin-wood furniture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and Persian carpet, her toilet-table loaded
with silver bottles and boxes, a large
silver-framed mirror, draped in real lace,
the silver-backed brushes, the cases of
perfume; and she thought with a shudder
of the poor little room at No. 2, with
its rickety table, shilling glass, and jug
without a handle. Deliberately, she
stood before the dressing-table, and deliberately
studied her reflection in the
costly mirror. How different she looked
to poor, haggard, shabby Mrs. Wynne,
the slave of a sick husband and a screaming
baby, with all the cares of a miserable
home upon her young shoulders; with no
money in her purse, no hope in her heart,
no future, and no friends!</p>

<p>Here she beheld Miss West, radiant
with health and beauty, her abundant
hair charmingly arranged by the deft-fingered
Josephine, her pretty, slim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
figure shown off by a simply made but
artistic twenty-guinea gown; her little
watch was set in brilliants, her fingers
were glittering with the same. She had
just risen from a dainty lunch, where she
was served by two powdered footmen
and the clerical butler. Her carriage is
even now waiting at the door, through
the open window she can hear the impatient
stamping of her six-hundred-guinea
horses.</p>

<p>She was about to call for an earl’s
daughter, who was to chaperone her to
a <i>fête</i>, where, from previous experience,
she knew that many and many a head
would be turned to look after pretty Miss
West; and she liked to be admired!
She had never gauged her own capacity
for pleasure until the last few months.
And Laurence required her to give up
all this, to rend the veil from her secret,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and stand before the world once more,
shabby, faded, insignificant Mrs. Wynne,
the wife of a briefless barrister!</p>

<p>Of course she was devoted to Laurence.
“Oh,” angrily to her own conscience,
“do not think that I can ever change to
him! But the hideous contrast between
that life and this! He must give me a
little more time—he must, he must! I
<i>must</i> enjoy myself a little!” she reiterated
passionately to her beautiful reflection.
“Once papa knows, I shall be
thrust out to beggary. I know I shall;
and I shall never have a carriage or a
French gown again.”</p>

<p>And this was the girl who, four
months previously, had pawned her
clothes for her husband’s necessaries,
and walked miles to save twopence!</p>

<p>Sudden riches are a terrible test—a
severe trial of moral fibre, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
when they raise a girl of nineteen, with
inherited luxurious tastes, from poverty,
touching starvation, to be mistress of
unbounded wealth, the daughter, only
child and heiress of an open-handed
Crœsus, with thousands as plentiful now
as coppers once had been.</p>

<p>“I will go down and see him. I must
risk it; there is no other plan,” she
murmured, as she rang her bell preparatory
to putting herself in the hands
of her maid. “Letters are so stupid. I
will seize the first chance I can find, and
steal down to the Holts, if it is but for
half an hour, and tell Laurence that he
<i>must</i> wait; he must be patient.”</p>

<p>And so he was—pathetically patient,
as morning after morning he waited in
the road and waylaid the postman, who
seldom had occasion to come up to the
farm; and still there was no letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Madeline was daily intending to rush
down, and day followed day without her
finding the opportunity or the courage
to carry out her purpose. And still
Laurence waited; and then he began to
fear that she must be ill. A whole week
and no letter! He would go to town and
inquire. No sooner thought of than
done. Fear and keen anxiety now took
the place of any other sensation, and
hurriedly making a change in his clothes,
and leaving a message for Mrs. Holt, he
set off to the station—three miles—on
foot, and took a third-class return to
London. Once there, he made his way—and
a long way it was—to the fashionable
quarter of Belgrave Square. It was a
sultry July afternoon, the very pavement
was hot, the air oppressive—people were
beginning to talk of Cowes and Scotland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many gay equipages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
were dashing about, containing society
notabilities and bright parasols. One of
these swept round a corner just as
Laurence was about to cross the street;
he had only a fleeting glimpse as it passed
by. A landau and pair of bay steppers,
with what is called “extravagant” action,
powdered servants, two ladies in light
summer dresses, and a young man, with
a button-hole and lavender gloves, on the
back seat.</p>

<p>One of the ladies had a faint resemblance
to Madeline, as well as could be
gathered, from an impression of bright
dark eyes, shaded by a French picture-hat
and a chiffon sunshade. No, it could
not be her. This was some patrician
beauty, who looked as if she had been
accustomed to such an equipage from
the days of her perambulator.</p>

<p>It was merely a passing idea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
quickly brushed aside by Laurence as he
once more walked on rapidly. At length
he approached the house—he was at the
same side of the square—within four
numbers now. His heart beat rather
quickly as he glanced up. No; none of
the upper blinds were pulled down, he
observed with relief, and then he took in
the dimensions of this palatial mansion,
with a porch and pillars, conservatory,
billiard-room, and buildings built out,
and built on, wherever they could be
crammed. The awnings were out—gay
red and white striped ones—banks of
flowers bloomed in the balconies. Oh,
what a contrast to Solferino Place!
Would not Madeline see it too? he asked
himself, with a pang. After a moment’s
hesitation he rang the bell, and almost
instantly the door was opened by a tall,
supercilious looking footman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Is—is—Miss—West at home?”
stammered her husband.</p>

<p>“Not at home,” replied the servant,
in a parrot voice, holding out his hand
for the card that he presumed would be
forthcoming.</p>

<p>“Is she quite well?” ventured the
visitor.</p>

<p>“Quite well, sir, thank you,” having
studied the questioner, and come to
the conclusion that he was not one of
your nobodies, like his worthy master.
“Who shall I say?” he asked confidentially.</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence. I have forgotten
my cards. I will call again,”
turning as he spoke and slowly descending
the steps.</p>

<p>This was a most rum go in Jeames’s
opinion. He might, at least, have left
his name! But no. Jeames stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
gazing after him, with what is called
“the door in his hand,” for two whole
minutes, glanced sleepily around the big,
white, hot-looking square, and then went
in to study the paper and the latest
betting on Goodwood.</p>

<p>Laurence made his way to Mr. Jessop’s
chambers, in—oh, extravagance!—a hansom,
and found that gentleman extremely
busy, and, as he expressed it,
“up to his ears.” He, however, knocked
off for the time being, in order to have a
smoke and a chat with his friend, whom
he declared that he found looking as fit
as a fiddle, and requested to know when
he was going to put his shoulder to the
wheel again?</p>

<p>“Lots for you to do, my boy. Martin
has married an heiress and cut the concern.
My sister has married the son of
old Baggs, of the great firm of Baggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
and Keepe, solicitors. My fortune is
made, and so is yours!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>“And, by Jove, old chap! those articles
of yours, in the <i>Pepper and Salt Magazine</i>,
have taken the whole baking—are regular
scorchers; lots of people are talking of
them, and asking if they are by the same
Laurence Wynne, of the Inner Temple—fellow
with a beard? Who would have
thought of your breaking out in that line,
eh? as ready with your pen as your
tongue.”</p>

<p>“Readier.”</p>

<p>“And look here, Larry, there is that
case of Cox <i>v.</i> Fox coming on, and you
can have a finger in the pie if you like.”</p>

<p>Larry did not clutch at this lucrative
opening; he puffed away moodily at a
cigarette, and stared out of the window
in rather an abstracted fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>His keen-eyed friend noted this, and
said, in a totally different key—</p>

<p>“And what about Mrs. Wynne?”</p>

<p>His companion looked at him quickly,
coloured faintly, threw his cigarette out
of the window, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“She has not told the old gentleman
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet.”</p>

<p>“So I surmised, as they say in
America. I saw her at the opera last
night, the cynosure of all eyes, and her
proud and happy father noting that half
the glasses in the house were fixed on
Miss West. Ahem! How long is it to
go on—this little comedy? Eh?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you!” impatiently. “Not
another hour as far as I am concerned. I
don’t wish her to sail under false colours
any longer. I came up to see her to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“The deuce you did!” in blunt
amazement.</p>

<p>“But she was out.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you saw the house and the
style. By Jove! it’s like royalty. I
dined there last week.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> did?” in unfeigned amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, your most humble servant. I’ve
met Mr. West at my club; he knows
a friend of mine—an impecunious lord—that
is all. The dinner was a banquet,
a feast fit for Lucullus himself. I had
the honour of being presented to Miss
West.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Of course I had never seen her
before,” winking at his friend. “And,
upon my word, I declare I scarcely
recognized her! Dress, diamonds, and
manner—manner begotten of importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
appreciation, wealth, and luxurious
surroundings. Not that Mrs. Wynne’s
manners were not always those of a
gentlewoman, but there is a difference
between doing the honours of a couple of
herrings and a sheep’s head, in one living
room, and being the hostess presiding
over a French dinner—with perfect appointments
and exotic flowers—entertaining
lords and ladies and bishops—eh?—and
doing it well, too. But wherever
she got her good blood, Laurence, it
did not come from her father’s side of the
house. I sometimes felt inclined to run
my fork into him, or to shy a wine-glass
at his head. He is so blatantly proud of
Robert West, his success, his money, his
grand acquaintances, and, above <i>all</i>, his
daughter. Excuse me, he is a thundering
little bounder!”</p>

<p>“You think he will be furious when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
he knows that he has a son-in-law?” said
Laurence, gravely.</p>

<p>“If you were a lord—or even a
baronet—and had some sort of handle to
your name——”</p>

<p>“But as I have nothing—not even
Q.C.?”</p>

<p>“I think, from what I know of him,
that he will be unpleasant, my dear
Larry—very unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“And the first shape that his unpleasantness
will take will be to turn
Madeline out of doors?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should say so—I think the
odds are fifty to one.”</p>

<p>“Well, she has her own home, at any
rate. I shall set to work on Monday.
I’ll go round and see about my old
chambers. You can send me those
papers, and tell Tom, the clerk, that I
am coming back for good. I shall take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
lodgings as soon as I have looked round—in
a more airy locality than Solferino
Place. Mrs. Holt will keep the child
till we are settled.”</p>

<p>“You—er—mean—you and Mrs.
Wynne?” looking curiously at his
companion.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; who else should I mean?”</p>

<p>“Does she say anything about returning?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” staring confusedly; “but it
is understood.”</p>

<p>Here ensued a short silence, during
which Mr. Jessop was nerving himself to
speak his mind to his friend—to speak
for that friend’s good—a thankless task,
but he assured himself that it was his
<i>duty</i>.</p>

<p>“Larry, old chap, you and I have been
pals since we were in jackets at Harrow,
and I’ve been your ally ever since the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
you licked Thompson, major, for pitching
into me. We’ve always stuck together
somehow ever since. I think a great
deal about your concerns. What hurts
you hurts me.”</p>

<p>“Out with it,” cried the other,
brusquely. “Out with it. I know you
are going to say something disagreeable.
That will do for the overture!”</p>

<p>“I must say one word to prepare
you, old man,” suddenly standing up,
laying his hand on his companion’s
shoulder, and looking down into his face.
“It is a fatal mistake to expect too
much in life—to be too sanguine!
Don’t—don’t be too sure that she <i>wants</i>
to come back.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br><span class="small">TWO VISITS AND A LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Miss West returned from her drive. She
had been to Lord’s to see the Oxford and
Cambridge cricket match. She had been
surrounded by admirers, like flies round
a pot of honey, and had the most eligible
<i>partis</i> of the season endeavouring to
win their way to her good graces as she
promenaded up and down between the
innings, and partook of tea and strawberries
in the tents; and Lady Rachel
(who had her own diversions) looked on
and said to herself, “That Madeline
was becoming much too run after, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Tony would have to mind what he was
about.” Meanwhile, Mr. West, for whose
society there was no competition,
hugged himself with joy, as he saw a
baronet and a baron approach Madeline
in turn. This was precisely as it should
be! Then he went up to Lord Tony
and said, “I say, Tony, wasn’t that the
Duke of Margate I saw you talking to
just now—a funny old Johnny, with a
shabby hat and red face?”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s—I—I believe so,” shrinking
instinctively from what he knew was
to follow—as per usual.</p>

<p>“Then just, when you get a nice little
opening, introduce <i>me</i>, there’s a good
fellow. Watch him when he comes out
of the long tent; he is having tea with
the FitzMorse Montagues. I’ll do as
much for you another time.”</p>

<p>Lord Tony dreaded these demands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
He even went so far as to hide from Mr.
West, or to absent himself altogether
from gatherings where they were likely
to meet. He had introduced his sister
to the Wests. He liked Madeline
immensely. His aunt, Lady Clapperclaw,
had called, and Miss West had got cards
from a few good houses, but he really
drew the line at presenting “the old
squatter,” as Mr. West was nicknamed
by all his acquaintances. People did
not <i>like</i> it. They glared fiercely when
this dapper, well-dressed, white-spatted,
white-hatted little person was introduced
to them—a man who bowed
and talked, and talked and grinned,
exactly like a toy monkey! Confound
Tony Foster, who the deuce was this
infernal little cad? What was Tony
about? He was always mixed up with
a second-rate set, but why thrust his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
shoddy friends on <i>them</i>? However, when
it came to be hinted that the “squatter”
was rolling in money, and dying
to spend it—literally panting to give
entertainments of the costliest description—a
second Monte Cristo, with a
spirit of unbounded generosity and one
lovely daughter—matters took a different
complexion. Mr. West was elected to a
couple of good clubs, some visiting-cards
and invitations were left on Mr. and
Miss West by footmen who had
descended from coroneted landaus.
Ladies with slim, smiling, scapegrace
sons called on the heiress. Fast young
married women, who looked forward
to dances and all manner of festivities,
called (and made their friends leave
cards). Young men who had seen and
admired Miss West got introduced, and
dropped in on Sundays. Lord Moneycute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
an elderly baron, who had long been
looking for a wife with money, also Sir
Crete Levanter, called—and they subsequently
dined—frequently at 365.
Many people whom the ignorant colonial
thought smart, grand, and distinguished,
called; but it was not all gold that
glittered; there was a great deal of
brass about some of these visitors! On
the other hand, pretty mammas, with
daughters who were in the best set,
set their faces against these parvenus.
Mammas with rich and titled sons were
equally stand-off. One or two great
ladies, who had been introduced, as it
were, accidentally to Miss West, cut her
at once.</p>

<p>But the Wests were as yet ignorant of
the lights and shades of London society,
and they were both—Mr. West especially—perfectly
satisfied that, though not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the Marlborough House set, they were
close upon its borders.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“A gentleman had called to see her,”
murmured Miss West languidly, as she
drew off her gloves on the threshold of
the morning-room. “Did he leave his
card?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, he did not; he said he
had forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“And he asked for me—not for Mr.
West?” she continued indifferently,
glancing at her parent, who was rapidly
turning over a pile of notes, and picking
out those emblazoned with a coronet.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you who it was,” he broke
in; “it was Lord Maltravers. He came
about that macaw he promised you.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” put in Jeames, firmly but
respectfully; “it was no gentleman I
ever saw before—certainly not Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Maltravers—though he might have been
a lord for all I know to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a tradesman?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir!” most emphatically.</p>

<p>“What was he like?” inquired Madeline,
opening a letter very deliberately as
she spoke, her thoughts very far away
from Laurence.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, he looked quite the
gentleman. He was tall, about my ’ight”
(complacently), “very dark eyes, a short
beard—what you’d consider a ’andsome
young man. He carried a queer-looking
stick with a ivory top, and he seemed
disappointed as you were not at home!”</p>

<p>“A queer-looking cane with an ivory
top, and he seemed disappointed!”
The letter fluttered out of Madeline’s
hands, and fell to the ground, as the
unconscious Jeames thus blandly announced
that the visitor had been her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
husband! She was glad to stoop quickly,
and thus hide her face, with its sudden
increase of colour. Laurence had come
up to see her! What rashness! What
madness!</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed her father, looking
at her sharply, “have you made
out your mysterious visitor, eh?—eh?—eh?”</p>

<p>“I think he must have been the
brother of one of my school-fellows from
the description,” she said, with wonderful
composure, tearing open another letter
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Mr. West, in a
tone that showed that school-fellows’
brothers were not at all in his line.</p>

<p>“Here is an invitation to Lord Carbuncle’s
for Thursday week,” said his
daughter, dexterously turning the current
of his thoughts into a much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
dangerous channel, and holding out the
note for his perusal.</p>

<p>“Thursday week. Let’s see; what is
there for Thursday week, eh?”</p>

<p>“We dine with the Thompson-Thompsons
in Portland Place.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear me, yes, so we do,” querulously.
“What a confounded nuisance!”
in a tone of intense exasperation. “Can’t
we throw them over?”</p>

<p>But his daughter gave him no encouragement,
knowing full well the
enormity of throwing people over when
a better engagement presented itself, and
that such proceedings were not countenanced
by good society in Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>So Mr. West (who was cheered by
another coroneted invitation-card) was
fain to submit with what grace he could
muster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning Miss West resolved
upon a bold step. She pleaded a headache
as an excuse from attending Sandown,
and as soon as she had seen her parent
safely off the premises, she hurried upstairs,
dressed herself very plainly, put
a black veil in her pocket—also a well-filled
purse—and, walking to a short distance,
took a hansom for Waterloo Station.
This time she travelled first class, of
course, and hired a fly to take her to the
farm—at least, to the lane leading to the
farm—and there to wait, in case Mr. Holt
was unable to drive her back. She desired
to give every one an agreeable surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holt, who was in the kitchen
shelling peas into a yellow bowl, gave
a little scream when she beheld Mrs.
Wynne standing on the threshold,
between her and the sunshine, and,
upsetting half the pods, rushed at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
hospitably, wiping her hands on her
apron, and assuring her that “she was
more welcome than the flowers in May.
Baby was well, and growing a rare size,
but Mr. Wynne was out; he and the
farmer had gone away together just after
breakfast, and would not be back till
late, and did ever anything happen so
contrary?”</p>

<p>Her square brow knit into lines of
disappointment when the young lady, in
answer to her eager queries, informed
her that she was not come to stay—that,
in fact, she was going to Ireland in two
or three days with her father and a party
of friends. He had taken the shooting of
a large estate in the south, and was most
anxious to inspect it.</p>

<p>“Ay, dearie, dearie me!” said Mrs.
Holt, after an eloquent pause, “and
what <i>will</i> Mr. Wynne say to that? I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
thinking he will not be for letting you
go,” and she shook her head dubiously.</p>

<p>This was precisely the subject that
Madeline had come to discuss with him,
and he was away for the day. How excessively
provoking and tiresome!</p>

<p>Mrs. Kane had been won over with
money, Mrs. Harper with valuable
presents, and the hint of an invitation
to stay at Belgrave Square. There
remained but Laurence to deal with.
He really must learn to be patient—to
wait for the auspicious moment when,
having gained the whole of her father’s
confidence and affection, he began to
realize that she was so absolutely
necessary to his happiness and to his
social success that he could never spare
her. Then, and not till then, would she
throw herself into his arms and confess
to him that she was married to Laurence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Wynne. Laurence and the baby would be
brought to Belgrave Square in triumph,
and share her lot in basking in the sun
of wealth and luxury. This was Mrs.
Wynne’s nice little programme, and ten
times a day she repeated to herself this
formula—“Laurence must wait.”</p>

<p>She kissed her little boy, and praised
his rosy cheeks, and asked many
questions about her husband, and was
so surprised to hear that he wrote for
hours and hours; but Mrs. Holt remarked
that she took no interest now in the
chickens, calves, or dogs—or, what she
once found irresistible, the dairy!</p>

<p>Also Mrs. Holt’s quick woman’s eye
did not fail to notice her blazing rings
when she pulled off her gloves, her
valuable little wristlet-watch, which she
consulted nervously from time to time,
her plain but expensive dress, that rustled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
when she moved. Ah! she could see—although
she tried not to show it—that
Mrs. Wynne had changed. Her mind
was possessed now by riches, and he,
poor young man, would never be able
to keep her contented, now she had had
the taste of money, and knew what it
was to be a great lady; and Mrs. Holt
shook her head wistfully, as she made
a red-currant tart. Meanwhile Madeline
carried baby down to the gate and looked
out for Laurence, but no Laurence came,
and baby was surprisingly heavy. Then
she went round the garden. Oh, how
small it looked somehow, and there was
horrid green weed on the pool! Then
she made her way into their sitting-room,
with its old glass book-case, brass-faced
clock, samplers hanging on the walls,
and plain red tiles underfoot. A dainty
summer breeze was playing with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
white curtains through the open lattice,
and the great hollyhocks and sunflowers
were rearing their heads and endeavouring
to peep in from the garden. There
was Laurence’s pipe; there, in a corner,
stood the stick which had betrayed him;
and there was his writing, just as he
had left it—ruled sermon paper. No, not
a letter! What was it all about? And
she took it up and glanced over it. It
was some rubbish, headed, “Middle-aged
Matrons.” How absurd!</p>

<p>Then, on the spur of the moment, she
called in Mrs. Holt, and consigned Master
Harry to her motherly arms, whilst she sat
down to indite a letter to Laurence, with
his own favourite pen and at his own table.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Laurence</span>” (she said),</p>

<p>“I came down on purpose to see
you, and am so dreadfully disappointed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
find you are out, for I dare not wait, and
I had so much to say to you. I am delighted
to find baby so grown, and to hear
such good accounts of yourself. I believe
you were at Belgrave Square yesterday.
Laurence, how could you be so rash? Fortunately,
no one suspected who you were,
or that you were anything to Miss West.
I feel quite another person than Miss
West now that I am down in the country,
and looking out of the window in front of
me into this dear old garden and the far-away
wooded hills.</p>

<p>“I feel as if money was nothing in
comparison to youth and domesticity and
peace, and that I could be happy here
for ever with you; but I know that, once
back in my own boudoir this very selfsame
evening, I shall change my mind
again, and look upon rustic life as intolerable—a
living death, a being buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
alive without a fashionable funeral.
Money and money’s worth I must attain;
love I have. I wish to command both—love
and money. We know what love is
without money, don’t we? I shall never,
never change to you, Laurence, you may
rely on that.</p>

<p>“I received your last letter safely, and
have laid to heart all you say; but, dear,
dear Laurence, you must let me take my
own time with papa. I will tell him
sooner or later; but, indeed, I am the
best judge of how and when and where.
You used to say I was foreseeing and
prudent and wise, in the days of No. 2.
Surely I am not changed in three months’
time! Leave it all to me. He will come
round yet, and, like the good people in
the fairy-tales, we shall live happy ever
after. On Sunday night we all go to
Ireland by the mail from Euston. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
is quite a sudden idea. Papa has given
up the idea of the Scotch moors, and was
talked into taking this shooting and deer-forest
and castle by an agreeable Irish
nobleman he met at his club. There
is every inducement to sportsmen, from
red deer to black cock, as well as three
thousand acres of ground and a castle.</p>

<p>“We are to have a succession of visitors.
I hope to do great things in three months,
and will write to you every week and
report progress.</p>

<p>“Ever, dear Laurence, your loving wife,</p>

<p class="right">
“M. W.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>His loving wife put this effusion into
an envelope, directed it, and placed it on
the mantelpiece, where it would be sure
to catch his eye, and then she felt considerably
relieved in heart and mind, and
had tea in the kitchen with Mrs. Holt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
turning the cakes and praising the butter,
and softening Mrs. Holt’s feelings the
longer she stayed in her company. Then
she had a confidential chat about baby
and his clothes, and placed twenty pounds
in her listener’s hand for his wardrobe, in
spite of that good woman’s protestation
that it was just five times too much.
She also made the farmer’s wife a substantial
present of money, telling her
very prettily, with tears in her eyes, that
it was not in return for her kindness, for
no sum could repay <i>that</i>, but as a small
token of gratitude.</p>

<p>By various means she reinstated herself
in Mrs. Holt’s good graces, and
having hugged the baby and kissed him
over and over again, and taken a hearty
leave of her hostess, she set off briskly on
foot to where the patient fly awaited her.
She paused at the end of the lane, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
looked back on the Holt farm. It was a
homely, sequestered spot, buried in fields
and trees, and very peaceful; but it
looked somehow more insignificant—shabbier
than she had fancied. How small
the windows were! How close it stood to
the big yard, with its swarming poultry
and calves and dirty duck-pond! And
what horrible knives and spoons Mrs. Holt
used, and what fearful shoes she wore!
However, she was a good old soul, and
had taken great care of baby. Then she
once more turned her back on the farm,
and set her face towards her father’s
luxurious mansion. Luckily for herself,
she was home before him—was dressed,
and sitting half buried in a chair, engrossed
in a novel, when he returned
in high good humour. He had been
winning and losing in the best of company,
and was very eloquent about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
certain Roman prince who had been uncommonly
pleasant, and had said he
“would like to be presented to you,
Madeline!” His little hard head was
so full of this new acquaintance that he
had not room for a thought as to where
or how his daughter had spent the day.
Indeed, from all evidence to the contrary,
she might never have been out of the
house.</p>

<p>Laurence found Madeline’s letter
staring at him from the mantelpiece
when he came home. He snatched it
eagerly, and devoured it then and there,
and as he came to the last line his sensations
were those of exceedingly bitter
disappointment—yes, and something
more, he was hurt. It seemed to him
that through the epistle ran an under-current
of jaunty indifference, and this
cut him to the quick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>And she was going to Ireland for three
months! Well, at any rate, he would see
her off; a railway station was open to the
public. She need not necessarily see
him; but he would see her. The next
day he carried out his intention, travelling
up to town early in the morning, visiting
his chambers, dining with his friend
Jessop, and being in good time to speed
the Irish mail at Euston. He watched
and waited, and saw many parties approach;
but yet not his particular party.
They did not appear until within five
minutes of the departure of the train.</p>

<p>And what a fuss they made! More than
all their predecessors put together. There
was one footman running for tickets,
another being carried madly along the
platform in tow of two powerful setters,
one retainer had the booking of the
luggage, another was arranging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
interior of their Pullman sleeping-car, and
then the party came up to it, and Laurence
beheld his father-in-law for the first
time—a neat, trim, bustling little man,
talking vociferously and gesticulating
about Lady Rachel’s luggage. There was
a very well-dressed, dark little woman,
not young, but juvenile in air and style,
who laughed and talked incessantly to a
big man in a tweed suit, and looked at Mr.
West with contemptuous grimaces, and
shrugged her shapely shoulders. There
was a “lout” in wonderful knicker-bockers—so
he mentally ticketed Lord
Tony. There was a tall girl in a sort of
long racing-coat. There were two lady’s-maids;
and last, but not least, there was
Madeline—Madeline so altered that he
could scarcely believe his eyes—Madeline
in a regal travelling-cloak, carrying a
Chinese lap-dog, giving directions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
hurrying footmen and maids, and dispensing
smiling adieux among a group of
young men who had come to see them
off—meaning Miss West. This was
surely not his Madeline—the little school-girl
he had married, the devoted, struggling,
hard-working wife and mother, late
of 2, Solferino Place. He stood back for
a moment in the shadow of the book-stall,
and realized for the first time the
immense gulf that divided him from
Mr. West’s heiress—the great yawning
chasm which lay between him and Madeline.
What would fill it—what? He
could think of no bridge but money.</p>

<p>Very poignant were his thoughts as
he stood thus—poor, aloof, and alone,
whilst his radiant wife made her beaming
farewells from the window of the Pullman
car.</p>

<p>“She should say good-bye to him too,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
he declared to himself, with sudden fierce
resolve, and, stepping forward, he stood
out in the full light, a little apart from
the gay group who were now removing
their hats with a real or simulated air of
regret as the great long train, that was to
carry the popular heiress westward, began
slowly to move. Madeline smiled and
nodded and waved her hand. But who
was that standing a little aside, farther
down the platform? It was Laurence—Laurence,
whom she had not beheld for
three months. It gave her quite a shock
to see him—but a pleasant shock, that
sent the blood tingling through her veins.</p>

<p>How well he looked!—quite himself
again; and how well he contrasted with
these gilded youths whom she had just
(she hoped) seen the last of! She would
have blown him a kiss had she dared; but
her father’s little beady eyes were upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
her, and she could only sit and look—she
might not even bow! Then, with
sudden compunction, and justly alarmed
by the expression on his face, she leant
quickly out of the window and nodded
and smiled.</p>

<p>The other young men accepted this
final signal with demonstrations of rapture.
Little did they guess that it was
not for them, but for that quiet, gentlemanly-looking
fellow a few yards to their
left. If they were not aware of this,
he was.</p>

<p>“Who is that man on the platform,”
said Lady Rachel, “that looks as if he
was seeing us off too? There is no one
else in the car but ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure I don’t know,” responded
Mr. West. “There are heaps of
people going over, though I dare say he
belongs to the Ravenstayle party. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Ravenstayle is in the train. It would
not surprise me if it were his nephew,
Cosmo Woodwing—aristocratic-looking
sort of chap—and took a good stare at
you, eh, Maddie?” facetiously. “Will
know you again next time he sees you?”—highly
delighted at his own conceit.
“I suppose you have no idea who he
is, eh?”</p>

<p>Madeline had an excellent idea of who
he was, but this was no time to confide
her secret to her parent—better to save
this little domestic bomb for a more discreet
opportunity.</p>

<p>Madeline had a shrewd idea that the
mysterious gentleman who had taken a
good long look at her—the presumable
Lord Cosmo Woodwing—was her own
husband!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br><span class="small">GONE TO IRELAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Laurence Wynne stood upon the platform
and watched the Irish mail—“The
Wild Irishman”—wind its great long
body slowly out of the station—watched
till the red light, like a fiery eye, became
smaller and smaller, and disappeared from
view. Then he hurried off to Waterloo
to catch his own train—which he missed—and,
going by the next, walked from
Guildford, a distance of twelve miles,
arriving home at one o’clock in the
morning, to the intense relief of Mrs.
Holt, who had been sitting up for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
in a nightcap of portentous dimensions,
and who, seeing that he looked tired and
dusty, and what she mentally termed
“down,” was disposed to be a very mother
to him, even to setting a cold supper
before him at that unparalleled and improper
hour, and staying him with a
flagon of her own home-brewed ale—a
sure token of favour.</p>

<p>“And so she’s gone!” she exclaimed
at last, when she could absolutely contain
herself no longer. “Actually gone
to Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Holt, she is gone,” acquiesced
her lodger, coolly.</p>

<p>“And goodness knows when she will
come back,” she continued indignantly.
“Dear, dear, dear! I wonder what <i>my</i>
master would say if I’d a done the like—just
walking off and leaving him and an
infant to fend for themselves; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
suppose fine folk is different, and don’t
mind?” giving her cap-frills a mighty
toss.</p>

<p>Laurence said nothing. He was not
going to tell this worthy and virtuously
irate matron, that he did mind very much.
No matter how he felt himself, he would
have every one else think well of Maddie.
He would hardly admit to his own heart
that she was not <i>quite</i> perfect, that he
was beginning to feel sorely jealous of
her father, her fine surroundings, and her
fashionable friends. However, there was
no use in thinking; what he had to do
was to work, and endeavour to win for
himself name, fame, and fortune.</p>

<p>The next morning he set himself to
make a real beginning. He packed up
his slender belongings, he took his last
walk round the fields and garden with
farmer Holt, he consigned his son to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
care of his kind hostess for the present,
and, promising to run down often and
look them up, he, in his turn, was taken
to the station by the chestnut colt, and
departed to make a fresh start in life,
whilst the burly farmer stood on the
platform and flourished his adieux with
a red-spotted handkerchief. Then, returning
slowly home, agreed with the
missus in finding the place “summat
lonely-like now,” in missing their late
inmate, and in praising him up to the
skies. Mrs. Holt was inclined to improve
the occasion by drawing invidious
comparisons between Mr. Wynne and his
wife. “She was not like him—he had
more true worth in his little finger than
she had in the whole of her body,” etc.</p>

<p>But the worthy master, who had not
been blind to Madeline’s pretty face and
fascinating smiles, would not listen for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
moment to such treason, and told his
better half, rather sharply, to “hold her
tongue!”</p>

<p>Laurence Wynne took up his quarters
in the Temple temporarily—in a set of
gloomy old chambers, with small, narrow
windows and small panes, looking out on
nothing in particular—at any rate he had
no view to distract his attention from his
work, and of work he had plenty.</p>

<p>His friend Jessop (unlike some so-called
friends), having got a good start
up the ladder of law, reached back a
hand to his struggling schoolfellow; and
an opening—a good opening—was all
that his struggling schoolfellow required.
His brains, his ceaseless industry, his good
address, and his handsome appearance
did the rest. He was far cleverer than
his friend Jessop, and had twice his perseverance
and talent for steady application.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Jessop could keep a bar dinner in a
roar of laughter, but Wynne could hold,
as it were, in his hand, the eyes and
ears of a jury. He had a natural gift for
oratory; he had a clear, sonorous voice;
he was never at a loss for a word—the
right word; never said too much, or too
little; never lost an opportunity of making
a point, or of driving home an argument.
In short, among the juniors he
was a pearl of price. His brilliant articles
of biting satire, which were read by every
one, had brought his name up, and his
name had been speedily followed by his
appearance in person—his appearance in
a successful case. In short, a tide in his
affairs had come, and he had taken it at
the flood, and the little skiff “success”
was sailing over the waves in gallant
style.</p>

<p>He had been most fortunate in one or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
two minor cases; he could not afford to
be careless, like great men who had made
their reputations. He began to be spoken
of as a very rising junior, and to be consulted
on crotchety points of law, to be
listened to whenever he opened his lips,
to be asked out to many professional
dinners, and to receive—oh, joy!—not a
few briefs on which the name of Laurence
Wynne was inscribed in a round legal
hand.</p>

<p>Yes, he was getting on rapidly. He
could now afford to pay well for the
maintenance of Master Wynne, to make
handsome presents to the Holts, to allow
himself new clothes and books, and the
luxury of belonging to a good club.</p>

<p>And what about Mrs. Wynne all this
time?</p>

<p>Madeline was rather agitated by so
unexpectedly beholding her husband on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the platform, the night they left for
Ireland. Her heart beat fast, and her
eyes were rather dim as they lost sight
of his figure in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Poor Laurence! How fond he was
of her,” she said to herself, with a sharp
pang of compunction. “Fancy his coming
up all that way, for just <i>one</i> glimpse, one
little look across the crowd!” But,
latterly, Madeline West had been so overwhelmed
with attention, that she now
took many things as a matter of course,
and but a proper tribute to her own importance.</p>

<p>She and Lady Rachel occupied the
same sleeping compartment, and her
ladyship, who was an old and experienced
traveller, wasted no time in gazing
dreamily out of the window like Madeline,
but took off her hat and dress and
lay down in her berth, and was soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
asleep, whilst the other sat with her
eyes fixed on the dusky country through
which they were passing, asking herself
many disturbing questions, and fighting
out a battle in her own breast between
Laurence and luxury. At times she had
almost resolved to tell her father all
within the next twelve hours, and to
accept the consequences, whatever they
might be. She was wrong to deceive
him; she was wrong to leave Laurence
and the child. Yes; she would do the
right thing at last—confess and go
back.</p>

<p>With this decision laboriously arrived
at, her mind was more at ease—a load
seemed lifted from her brain; and she
laid her head on her pillow at last and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>But morning brings counsel—we do
not say that it always brings wisdom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
In the cool, very cool dawn, as she sat on
the deck of the <i>Ireland</i> and watched the
sun rise and the shores of Erin rise into
view, her courage ebbed away; and as
she partook of a cup of hot coffee at
Kingsbridge Station, and encountered
her father, who was exceedingly short
in his temper, owing to a bad night’s
rest, her good intentions melted as snow
before the sun. No, no, she told herself;
she must wait until her parent was
in a more genial, indulgent mood. To
speak now would be fatal, even supposing
there was an opportunity for a
few moments’ <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>The party travelled down at express
speed to Mallow Junction, and from
there a short rail journey brought them
near their destination. It was four
o’clock on a superb August afternoon
as they drove up to Clane Castle. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
owner and agent had not misled the
new tenants; it <i>was</i> a castle, a fine commanding
structure tucked under the
wing of a great purple mountain, and
was approached by an avenue that
wound for a full Irish mile through a
delightful demesne. What oaks! what
beeches! what green glades and scuttling
rabbits! what cover for woodcock!
and, outlined against the sky-line on the
mountain, was that a deer?</p>

<p>The exclamations of pleasure and
astonishment from his daughter and his
guests made Mr. West’s tongue wag
freely.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s a fine place. I said,
‘None of your picnic shanties for me.’
I said, ‘I must have a decent house
and a fair head of game—money no
object,’” he explained volubly, as he
strutted before the party into a noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
dining-room, where a very <i>recherché</i> meal
awaited them.</p>

<p>The travellers, fortified by an excellent
repast, and filled with an agreeable sense
of well-being, repaired to their several
chambers to get rid of their dusty garments,
and met once more in the library,
and sallied forth to see the place, Mr.
West acting as guide and cicerone, and
conducting his followers as if he had
been born on the premises. The eyes
of appreciative sportsmen sparkled as
they took in the miles of mountain, the
forests, the extent of heather, stretching
widely to the horizon, and felt more
than ever, that little West, by Jove!
knew what he was about when he asked
a fellow to shoot, and did you right
well.</p>

<p>Besides the far-reaching mountains,
there were other attractions—a lake and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
boathouse, a fine garden and pleasure-ground,
a tennis-court, and—oh, joy!—a
capital billiard-table. Every one expressed
their delight with the castle, the
scenery, the weather, and soon settled
down to enjoy themselves in their several
ways.</p>

<p>The twelfth of August produced a
splendid bag of grouse, surpassing even
the head-keeper’s fondest prediction.
Every one of the neighbouring “quality”
called of their own free will. There were
celebrated tennis-parties, and dinners at
the Castle (Mr. West had brought his
own cook), and the fame of the excellent
shooting went far and near. Mr. West
was jubilant; he felt a grand seigneur.
Never had he been a personage of such
importance, and he actually began to
look down on his London acquaintances.</p>

<p>“The shooting is A1—every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
knows that,” he said. “Courtenay wants
to know <i>how</i> I like the place?—a deuce
deal better than I like him; and Dafford
writes to ask if I can give him a day or
two? I’m not very hot on Dafford. He
wasn’t over and above civil, and he never
got his sister, Lady Dovetail, to call;
but he’d like to make use of me now.
If I’m not good enough for him in
London, he isn’t good enough for me
here. Oh no, Mr. Dafford; you don’t
come to Clane Castle!” And putting his
thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat,
Mr. West trotted up and down his daughter’s
morning-room exuberantly happy.</p>

<p>Madeline was happy, too, but from
other causes. The lovely scenery, the
free yet luxurious life, the entire novelty
of her surroundings, the impulsive gay-spirited
gentry, the finest peasantry in
the world, with their soft brogue, wit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
blarney, and dark eyes, all enchanted her.
The only little clouds upon her sky were
a spirit of discontent among her English
retinue, and a certain indefinable coolness
and constraint in Laurence’s weekly
letter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br><span class="small">WANTED—A REASON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The guests at the castle were, as notified
in a local paper, Lady Rachel Jenkins
and Mr. Jenkins, the Honourable Mrs.
Leach, Lord Anthony Foster, Miss
Pamela Pace, Miss Peggy Lumley,
Captain Vansittart, and Major Mostyn,
of the Royal Sedleitz Dragoons.</p>

<p>The Honourable Mrs. Leach was a
handsome widow, whose income was
much beneath her requirements. She
was acquainted with some colonials,
who had come home in the same ship
as Mr. West, and was indebted to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
for an introduction to her present comfortable
quarters. She had a smooth,
slow sort of manner, a pair of wonderfully
expressive eyes—and her own
little plans. It did not suit her to
walk with the guns, or join in long
expeditions, entailing wear and tear of
clothes, nerves, complexion, and tissues.
She much preferred to lounge over a
novel in the grounds, having breakfasted
in her own room, and would appear at
teatime before the battered, sun-burnt,
sun-blistered company, a miracle of cool
grace, in a costume to correspond. And
her brilliant appearance of an evening
was a pleasure that was generally looked
forward to. What toilettes!—so rich,
so well-chosen and becoming! What
diamonds! (Yes; but these were the
best French paste.) She made herself
pleasant to every one, especially to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
West, and treated Madeline almost as if
she were some fond elder sister.</p>

<p>Miss Pamela Pace was excessively
lively—the soul of the party, always
ready to shoot, ride, or fish; to play
billiards, gooseberry, or the banjo; to
dance or to act charades. She had a
fund of riddles, games, and ghost stories.
Without being pretty, she was neat,
smart, and a general favourite.</p>

<p>Miss Lumley was her cousin and her
foil—tall, fair, statuesque, and silent.
However, she was a capital tennis and
billiard player, an untiring pedestrian;
and, as Lady Rachel talked enough for
two ordinary women, she made up for
Miss Lumley’s shortcomings.</p>

<p>Lady Rachel was most anxious to get
her brother settled—married to a nice
girl, such as Madeline, with a large
fortune, and she intended to forward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
match in every way. She lost no opportunity
of sounding Tony’s praises to
Madeline, or of plying him with encouragement
and advice. Advice, especially
given as such for his own good, he
shirked, as a child does physic. He
admired Miss West. She was unaffected;
there was no nonsense about her; she
was handsome and ladylike. She would
accept him, of course; and he really
might do worse. He did not particularly
want to marry her, or any one; but his
income, no matter how well contrived
and cut, was far too small for a man of
his position. And money was a pleasant
thing.</p>

<p>Wound up by his anxious sister,
Lord Tony had asked for and obtained
Mr. West’s permission to speak to his
daughter, and now the only thing that
remained to do was to ask the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
lady to ratify the treaty. They had been
nearly three weeks in Ireland, whilst this
affair was quietly brewing.</p>

<p>Madeline had no suspicion of her
father’s wishes, or her suitor’s intentions;
such an idea would have filled her—as
it subsequently did—with horror. She
liked dancing and tennis, and amusing
herself as much as other young women of
her age; but the notion of any one falling
in love with her, in her new and attractive
character, never once entered her
brain. Pretty speeches and compliments
she laughed at and turned aside; and it
was generally mooted that the Australian
heiress was as cold as the typical iceberg,
and had a genius for administering the
most crushing snubs if any one ventured
on to the borderland, yea, the very
suburbs of love-making; and it had been
hinted that either there was some pauper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
lover in the background, or that Miss
West was waiting for a duke—English
or foreign—to lay his strawberry leaves
at her feet. She thought Lord Tony
extremely plain, and rather stupid; but
he was so easily entertained, and cheery,
and helped to make things go off well,
that she was glad he formed one of the
party. She had seen so much of him in
London, she knew him better than any
of their young men acquaintances; and
he was always so good-tempered, so unassuming,
and so confidential, that she
entertained quite a sisterly regard for him.</p>

<p>Of Lord Anthony’s present views and
intentions she had no more idea than
her pet Chinese spaniel. If he was <i>épris</i>
with any one, it was with the dashing
Pamela, who told his fortune by cards,
and played him even at billiards; and
his proposal came upon her without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
preparation, and like a bolt from the blue.
The bolt fell in this fashion, and on a
certain sleepy Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Sunday at Clane had many empty
hours. Mr. West was old-fashioned, and
set his face against shooting, tennis,
billiards, or even that curate’s own game—croquet.
The hours after lunch were
spent in smoking, sleeping, novel-reading,
devouring fruit in the big garden, or
sitting under the lime-trees. It was thus
that Lord Anthony found Madeline, surveying
the misty haze of a hot August
afternoon with a pair of abstracted eyes.
Mr. West had given him a hint of her
whereabouts, and that here was the hour,
and he was the man!</p>

<p>“She is a cold, undemonstrative,
distant sort of girl,” he explained. “She
has never had a fancy, that I know of”
(no, certainly as yet, he had not known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of it). “She likes you, I am sure; it
will be all plain sailing.” And, thus encouraged,
the suitor figuratively put to
sea.</p>

<p>Madeline sat alone under the lime-trees
in a low wicker chair, having been
deserted by Lady Rachel, who had gone
to have a comfortable snooze ere teatime.</p>

<p>It was a drowsy afternoon; the bees
buzzed lazily over a bed of mignonette,
which sent its fragrance far and near.
Madeline’s book lay neglected in her lap.
Her thoughts were far from it and Clane;
they were with a certain hard-working
barrister in London, who had written her
a very rough, outspoken letter. Poor
Laurence! Why could he not wait?
Why could he not have patience? He
was beginning to get on so well. She
had seen a long review of one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
articles in <i>Tooth and Nail</i>. He was becoming
quite a literary celebrity.</p>

<p>And, once he was up the ladder, even
a few rungs, she would not feel the
change so bitter, supposing her father
was furious and implacable. Of course
it would be a change! And she sighed
as she smoothed out her cambric gown—which
had cost eighteen guineas—with
a pretty, delicate hand, laden with magnificent
rings. Could it be possible that
those soft white hands had ever blackened
grates and made beds and washed up
plates? Oh, such greasy plates and
dishes!</p>

<p>“You seem to be in a day-dream, Miss
West,” said Lord Anthony, as he approached,
“and all the rest of the folk
have gone to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Have they?” she exclaimed. “Well,
one cannot wonder! It is a broiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
afternoon, and, after that long sermon,
you must make allowances.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m always making allowances.
I’m an easy-going sort of fellow, you
know,” and he cast himself into a well-cushioned
chair. “I want to have a
little talk with you.” Hitching this chair
nearer he added, “May I?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course! But are we in a
talking humour? Isn’t it rather hot?
Pray don’t bore yourself to entertain me!
I can always amuse myself,” and she
slowly agitated her great green fan.</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose you can say ‘My
mind to me a kingdom is’?” he asked,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I think I can,” she answered languidly.</p>

<p>“I wish <i>I</i> could say as much. My
mind is a poor, barren, unpopulated
country. I should like to take a trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
into your territory, and share your
pleasant thoughts, Miss West!” then
suddenly spurred by a recollection of a
solemn promise to his sister, and that he
was wasting a golden opportunity, “I
have something important to say to you.”</p>

<p>“To say to <i>me</i>?” she echoed, with
raised brows. “What can it be? What
makes you look so strange? You are not
feeling ill, are you?”</p>

<p>“Ill! No; but my mind is ill at ease.
Can you not form an idea why?” leaning
forward as he spoke, and looking straight
into her eyes.</p>

<p>His look was an illumination to Madeline.
But as yet she did not think of
herself; she mentally glanced at lively
Pamela, with her high spirits and low
stature. She had seen her present
companion carry his rather boisterous
attentions to that young lady’s shrine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
She amused him, and his loud, long
laugh often resounded in her neighbourhood.
He was come to ask for her
good offices; but she did not suppose
that Miss Pam would be unusually
difficult to win.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I have an idea now,”
she murmured, with a significant smile.
“I have guessed.”</p>

<p>“You have?” he replied, in a tone
of great relief. “And—and, may I
venture to hope?”</p>

<p>“I really cannot tell you. But I see
no reason why you should not,” she
returned reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Madeline”—now moving his chair
a whole foot nearer, and suddenly taking
her hand—“you have made me the
happiest of men!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I quite understand
you,” she replied, struggling to withdraw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
her fingers, and feeling desperately uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Then I must speak out more plainly.
I want you to promise to be my wife.”</p>

<p>For a second she stared at him as if
she could not credit her ears. Then
she suddenly wrenched her fingers away,
sprang to her feet, and stood facing him
with crimson cheeks.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Are you—mad?”
she asked sharply.</p>

<p>“Mad?—no!” replied her suitor, both
amazed and affronted. “One would
think I was a dangerous lunatic, the
way you behave. I am quite sane, and
in deadly earnest. I have your father’s
good wishes, Rachel’s good wishes——”</p>

<p>“My father’s good wishes!” she interrupted,
her mind in a perfect tumult
at this totally unlooked-for dilemma.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
West? Why are you so upset and
agitated? Am I so totally unworthy?
Is there anything so extravagantly
strange in my wishing to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no!”—endeavouring to control
her feelings, and not give herself
away. “But—but——” A scarlet wave
rushed into her cheeks. But what would
Laurence say?</p>

<p>“Is it to be ‘Yes’ or ‘No’?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>She simply shook her head, and drew
back a step or two.</p>

<p>He had never been so near to loving
this tall pretty girl, standing under the
lime-trees with flushed, averted face, as
now, when she shook her head.</p>

<p>“At least you will give me <i>reason</i>,”
he demanded, rather sulkily.</p>

<p>As the words left his lips he saw an
odd change pass across her face, an
expression that he could not understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
It was a look half of fear, half of contemptuous
derision.</p>

<p>“There is no reason,” she answered
quietly, “beyond the usual one in a similar
case. I do not wish to marry you.”</p>

<p>“And why?” he asked, after an
appreciable pause.</p>

<p>“Well, really, I have never thought
about you, Lord Anthony, but as a
pleasant acquaintance. As an acquaintance
I like you very much,” she
answered, with astounding calmness.
“An acquaintance—but nothing more.”
And she turned to take up her parasol.</p>

<p>Opposition always roused Lord Anthony;
it acted as a spur. In a short
five minutes he saw everything from his
sister’s point of view, and had suddenly
developed a passion for Miss West.</p>

<p>“Every marriage begins by an acquaintance.
Perhaps in time,” he urged—“in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
a few short months, my dearest
Madeline——”</p>

<p>“I am not your ‘dearest Madeline,’
Lord Anthony,” she interrupted quickly.
“Pray consider the subject closed once
for all; and remember, for the future,
that I am Miss West.”</p>

<p>She was getting angry with his persistency.
He was getting angry with
her persistency.</p>

<p>There ensued a long silence, unbroken
by speech. And at last he said—</p>

<p>“There is some other fellow, of course.
You are engaged already.”</p>

<p>“I am not. Oh, Pamela, I did not
see you”—as that vivacious young lady
suddenly came upon the scene with a
strong escort of dogs.</p>

<p>From her window she had noted the
conference, and had hastily descended
in order to discover what it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
portend. A proposal! Well, if he had
proposed, he had <i>not</i> been accepted, she
remarked to herself complacently.</p>

<p>They both looked confused and ill at
ease. Evidently they had been quarrelling.
Lord Anthony was ridiculously
red, and Madeline was white as a sheet.</p>

<p>“How delightfully cool and comfortable
you two look!” she mendaciously
ejaculated, sinking into Madeline’s chair
with a gesture of exhaustion. “This
is quite the nicest place, under these
motherly old trees. I’ve been trying to
sleep, but it did not come off. I was
driven quite frantic by a diabolical bluebottle,
that would not keep away from
my face.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t wonder,” said
Lord Anthony, who was recovering his
good temper, which was never lost for
long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“And so I came out. You will have
tea here, Maddie, won’t you, like a
duck?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that ducks care for tea,”
rejoined Madeline. “Their weakness is
snails. But I’ll run in and order it. It
must be after five.” And in another
minute her tall white figure was half-way
to the castle, and Miss Pamela and Lord
Anthony were alone.</p>

<p>Both were eager to question the other
in a delicate, roundabout way. Strange
to say, the man got out his query first.
Throwing himself once more into a chair,
and crossing his legs, he said—</p>

<p>“Girls know girls and their affairs, as
men know men, and are up to their little
games. Now, you saw a lot of Miss
West in town. Same dressmaker, same
dentist, same bootmaker. Look here,
now; I want to know something.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
he bent over and gazed into Miss Pam’s
pale little dancing eyes.</p>

<p>“I am quite at your service,” she
answered smilingly. “Her waist is
twenty inches. She takes a longer skirt
than you would think. She has no false
teeth, and only a little stuffing in one
back molar. Her size in shoes is fours.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! What do I care about her
teeth and her shoes? I want to know—and
I’ll do as much for you some day—if
Miss West has any hanger-on—any
lover loafing round? Of course I know
she had heaps of Johnnies who admired
her. But did she seem sweet on them?
‘Lookers-on see most of the game.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, when there is any game to see,”
retorted the young lady. “In this case
there was none. Or, if there was, it was
double dummy.”</p>

<p>“No one?” he said incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“No one,” she answered. “She talks
like an old grandmother, who has been
through every phase of life; talks in the
abstract, of course. She has never, as
far as I know, and in the language of
romance, ‘smiled on any suitor.’”</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary!” muttered Lord
Anthony. “A new woman who bars
men. However, there is always the one
exception; and, by George”—to himself—“I’ll
have another try!”</p>

</div>


<p>“Well!” said Mr. West, when he found
himself alone in the smoking-room with
Lord Anthony. How much can be expressed
in that exclamation.</p>

<p>“It was not well, sir. She will have
nothing to say to me. I had no luck.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean with Maddie?” exclaimed
her father, in a tone of fretful
amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes. I had a long talk with her,
and she won’t have anything to say to
me!”</p>

<p>“What—what reason did she give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
you?” demanded Mr. West. “What
reason, I say?”</p>

<p>“None, except that she did not wish
to marry me; and she seemed to think
that reason <i>enough</i>.”</p>

<p>“And did you not press her?”</p>

<p>“It was of no use; but, all the same,
I intend to try again—that is, if there
is no one else, and Miss West has no
attachment elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Attachment elsewhere? Nonsense!”
irritably. “Why, she was at <i>school</i> till
I came home—till she met me on the
steamer with her governess! You saw
her yourself; so you may put that out
of your head. She’s a mere girl, and
does not know her own mind; but I
know mine, and if she marries to please
me, I’ll settle forty thousand pounds on
her on her wedding day, and allow her
five thousand a year. It’s not many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
girls in England who have as much
pinned to their petticoat; and she will
have considerably more at my death. If
you stick to Maddie, you will see she
will marry you eventually. She knows
you, and is getting used to you—coming
in and out in London; and you
have a great pull over other men, staying
here in the same house, with lots of wet
days perhaps!”</p>

<p>The following morning Madeline was
sent for by her father. He felt that he
could speak with more authority from
the ’vantage ground of the hearthrug in
his own writing-room; and after breakfast
was the time he selected for the
audience. Evidently Madeline had no
idea of what was awaiting her, for she
came up to him and laid her hand upon
his arm, and gave him an extra morning
kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose it’s about this picnic to
the Devil’s Pie-dish?” she began.</p>

<p>In no part of the world has the
devil so much and such a various property
as in Ireland—glens, mountains,
bridges, punch-bowls, bits, ladders—there
is scarcely a county in which he has not
some possessions—and they say he is a
resident landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. West propped himself against the
mantelpiece and surveyed her critically.
She was certainly a most beautiful creature—in
her parent’s fond eyes—and
quite fitted to be sister-in-law to a
duke.</p>

<p>“It’s not about the picnic; that must
be put off, the day has broken. It’s
something far more important. Ahem!”
clearing his throat. “What’s all <i>this</i>
about you and Foster?”</p>

<p>“Why?” she stammered, colouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
deeply, and struck by a peculiar ring in
his voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Why?</i>” impatiently. “He tells me
that he proposed to you yesterday, and
you refused him point-blank; and now,
in my turn, <i>I</i> ask why?”</p>

<p>Madeline was silent. She began to
feel very uncomfortable, and her heart
beat fearfully fast.</p>

<p>“Well, is it true?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite true,” fiddling with her
bangles.</p>

<p>“And may I know why you have said
<i>no</i> to a highly eligible young man, of a
station far above your own, the son of
a duke—a man young, agreeable, whose
name has never appeared in any flagrant
society scandal, who is well-principled
and—and—good-looking—a suitor who
has my warmest approval? Come now.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
And he took off his glasses and rapped
them on his thumb nail.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to marry,” she replied
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“And you <i>do</i> wish to drive me out of my
senses! What foolery, what tommy rot!
Of course, you <i>must</i> marry some day—you
are bound to as my heiress; and I look to
you to do something decent, and to bring
me in an equivalent return for my outlay.”</p>

<p>“And you wish me to marry Lord
Anthony?” inquired his unhappy daughter,
pale to the lips. Oh, if she could
but muster up courage to confess the
truth! But she dared not, with those
fiery little eyes fixed upon her so fiercely.
“Father, I cannot. I cannot, indeed!”
she whispered, wringing her hands together
in an agony.</p>

<p>“Why?” he demanded in a hoarse,
dry voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Would you barter me and your money
for a title?” she cried, plucking up some
spirit in her desperation, “as if I was
not a living creature, and had no feeling.
I <i>have</i> feeling. I have a heart; and it
is useless for you to attempt to control
it—it is out of your power!”</p>

<p>This unexpected speech took her parent
aback. She spoke with such passionate
vehemence that he scarcely recognized
his gay, cool, smiling, and unemotional
Madeline.</p>

<p>This imperious girl, with trembling
hands, sharply knit brows, and low, agitated
voice, was entirely another person.
This was not Madeline, his everyday
daughter. At last it dawned upon his
mind that there was something behind
it all, some curious hidden reason in
the background, some secret cause for
this astonishing behaviour! Suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
griping her arm in a vice-like grasp, as an
awful possibility stirred his inflammable
spirit, he whispered through his teeth—</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Who is who?” she gasped faintly.</p>

<p>Ah! now it was coming. She shook
as if she had the ague.</p>

<p>“Who is this scoundrel, this low-born
adventurer that you are in love with?
Is it the man you knew at school? Is
it the damned dancing-master, or some
half-starved curate? Is it him you want
to marry? Madeline, on your oath,”
shaking her in his furious excitement and
passion of apprehension, “is it him you
want to marry?” he reiterated.</p>

<p>Madeline turned cold, but she looked
full into the enraged face, so close to
hers, and as he repeated, “On your oath,
remember!” she answered with unfaltering
and distinctly audible voice, “On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
my oath—<i>no!</i>” She spoke the truth,
too! Was she not married to him
already? Oh, if her father only guessed
it! She dared not speculate on the idea!
He would be worse, far worse than her
worst anticipations. She could <i>never</i> tell
him now.</p>

<p>“Father, I have said ‘No,’” she
continued. “Let go my hand, you
hurt me.” With the utterance of the
last word she broke down and collapsed
upon the nearest chair, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you crying for?”
he demanded angrily. “What I’ve said
and done, I’ve done for your good. Take
your own time, in reason; but marry you
<i>shall</i>, and a title. Foster is the man
of my choice. I don’t see what you can
bring against him. We will all live together,
and, for my own part, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
<i>like</i> it. You go to no poorer home, you
become a lady of rank,—what more can
any girl want? Money as much as she
can spend, a husband and a father who
hit it off to a T, both only too anxious
to please her in every possible way, rank,
and riches; what more would you have,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know all that!” gasped Madeline,
making a great effort to master
her agitation. She must protest now or
never. “I know everything you would
say; but I shall never marry Lord
Anthony, and I would be wrong to let
you think so. I like him; but, if he
persists, I shall hate him. I have said
‘No’ once; let that be sufficient for him—and
<i>you</i>!” Then, dreading the consequences
of this rashly courageous speech,
she got up and hurried out of the room,
leaving her father in sole possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the rug, and actually gasping for speech,
his thin lips opening and shutting like
a fish’s mouth—when the fish has just
been landed. At last he found his voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t care one (a big D) for Madeline
and her fancies, and this thunder in
the air has upset her. A woman’s no
means yes; and she shall marry Foster
as sure as my name is Robert West.”
To Lord Anthony he said, “I’d a little
quiet talk with Madeline, and your name
came up. She admitted that she liked
you; so you just bide your time and wait.
Everything comes to those who wait.”</p>

<p>To this Lord Tony nodded a dubious
acquiescence. The poor fellow was
thinking of his creditors. How would
they like this motto? and how much
longer would <i>they</i> wait?</p>

<p>“I told you she liked you,” pursued
Mr. West consolingly—“she said so;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
so you have not even to <i>begin</i> with a
little aversion. She has set her face
against marriage; she declared she would
not marry, and what’s more—and this
scores for you—she gave me her word
of honour that there was no one she
<i>wished</i> to marry. So it’s a clear course
and no favour, and the best man wins.
And remember, Tony,” said her shrewd
little parent, thumping, as he spoke, that
gentleman’s reluctant shoulder, “that I
back you, and it’s a good thing to have
the father and the money on your side,
let me tell you.”</p>

<p>Ten days went by very quietly—the
calm after the storm. Mr. West never
alluded to his daughter’s foolish speech,
and kissed her and patted her on the
shoulder that selfsame night, as if there
had been no little scene between them
in the morning. He was waiting. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Anthony, even in Madeline’s opinion,
behaved beautifully. He did not hold
himself too markedly aloof, and yet he
never thrust his society upon her, or
sought to have a word with her alone.
He also was waiting.</p>

</div>


<p>The postponed picnic to the Devil’s Pie-dish
eventually came off. It took place
on the occasion of what was called “a
holiday of obligation,” when no good
Catholics are allowed to work, but must
put on their best clothes and attend Mass.
As there were no keepers or beaters
available, the shooting-men meekly submitted
to their fate, and started to the
mountains, for once, minus dogs and
guns, and escorting a large assortment
of ladies, in a break, landau, dog-cart,
and jaunting-car. The morning was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
lovely; the treacherous sun smiled upon
and beguiled the party to the summit of
one of the mountains—a wild spot commanding
a splendid view of river, forest,
lake, and sea—a long, long climb, but it
repaid the exertion. Luncheon was laid
out in the Pie-dish, a green hollow between
two peaks, and it was there discussed
with great appreciation. The festive party
sat long. Gradually, almost imperceptibly,
mists began to collect, clouds to gather;
the scenery at their feet grew dimmer
and yet dimmer, the hypocritical sunshine
vanished and gave way to rain,
heavy, stinging rain. There was no
shelter, not for miles—not a bush, much
less a tree; but at a distance some one
descried what looked like a <i>mound of
stones</i>, but proved to be a cottage. To
this dwelling every one ran at their utmost
speed. It certainly was a house—a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
humped-back cot that seemed as if it
had been in the act of running down
hill and had sat down. It consisted of
a kitchen and bedroom, and the former
could scarcely contain the company,
even standing. There were one or two
stools, a chest, and a chair. The atmosphere
was stifling, but “any port in a
storm;” anything sooner than the icy,
cutting rain that swept the mountain.
When their eyes became accustomed to
the place, it turned out that besides
smoke and hens, it contained an old
woman, who sat huddled up by the fire
enjoying a pipe, and who stared stolidly
and made no answer to eager inquiries
for permission to remain. She was either
stone deaf or silly, possibly both. But
suddenly a barefooted girl entered, with
a creel of wet turf on her back.</p>

<p>“I see yees running, and yees are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
kindly welcome,” upsetting her load in
a corner, and shaking out her wet shawl.
“The grannie, there,” pointing, “has no
English; ’tis only Irish she can spake.”</p>

<p>“Irish! Oh, I’d like to hear it so
much!” cried Miss Pamela. “Oh, do
make her talk!” Exactly as if she were
alluding to some mechanical toy, such
as a talking-doll.</p>

<p>“She’s not much of a talker, at all,
miss—and she’s cruel old; and so many
quality coming in on her at once has
a bit stunned her. I’m sorry we are
short of sates,” looking round, and proffering
the turf creel to Lady Rachel.
“And I’ve no tay, but lashins of butter-milk.”</p>

<p>“Never mind anything, thank you,”
said Mr. West, pompously; “we have
just lunched.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an’ is that yourself, me noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
gentleman, from the castle below! An’
’tis proud I am to see yees. And here’s
Michael for ye,” as a tall dark countryman
with long black whiskers entered,
amazement at the invasion depicted in
his dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>“’Tis a wet day, Michael,” said Mr.
West, who employed him as a beater.</p>

<p>“’Tis so, yer honour.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will last?” asked
Madeline.</p>

<p>“I could not rightly say, miss; but I
think not. It come on so sudden.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have been to the town
to Mass?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; second Mass.”</p>

<p>“Did you meet any friends, Micky?
Did you get a drink?” inquired Lord
Tony, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“No, not to say a drink, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Just a <i>taste</i>.”</p>

<p>“And if you were to be treated, Mick,
what would you choose? Give it a
name, now,” said Lord Tony, genially.</p>

<p>“Oh, whisky and porter!”</p>

<p>“What, together?”</p>

<p>“Ay. And why not? Sure, ’tis the
best in many ways.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“Faix! an’ with raison. If I drink
porter I’m full before I’m drunk, ye see;
if I drink whisky, I’m drunk before I’m
full, and both together comes about
right.”</p>

<p>“Michael,” cried his wife, “’tis you
as ought to be dead ashamed, talking in
such a coarse, loose way before the
ladies! Ye has them all upset, so ye
has.” And, to make a diversion, she
darted into the room and returned with
(by way of a treat for the ladies) a baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
in her arms. It had weak, blinking, blue
eyes, was wrapped in an old shawl, and
was apparently about a month old. However,
it created quite the sensation its
mother had anticipated.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord,” cried Mr. West, “a baby!
I hate babies, though I like small children—especially
little boys! Take it
away before it starts screaming.”</p>

<p>“Oh, show it to me! Let me have
it!” came simultaneously from several
quarters; but in each case the baby
received its new friend with a yell, and
had to be promptly returned to its apologetic
parent. Several had tried their
hand upon it; Miss Pam, Mrs. Leach,
Miss Lumley, and Lady Rachel had
been repulsed in turn.</p>

<p>“Now, Maddie, let us see what way
you would manage it, or if you know
which end is uppermost!” said Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Rachel, taking the child from its mother,
and laying it in Madeline’s arms.</p>

<p>After a storm a calm! The irritable
infant was actually quiet at last, and
glared at his new nurse in silence; and
whilst Madeline hushed it and rocked
it, and talked to it in a most approved
fashion, the delighted mother and granny
looked on with grateful surprise. And
then the old lady made some loud remark
in Irish, and pointed her pipe at
Madeline.</p>

<p>“What does she say? Oh, do tell
us?” cried Miss Pamela, excitedly.
“<i>Do—do</i>, please!”</p>

<p>“Oh, miss dear, I—I—faix, then I
couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“’Tis no harm whatever,” broke in
Michael, with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Then out with it!” commanded Mr.
West from a corner, where he was sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
on a kist, swaying his little legs high
above the ground, and fully expecting
to hear some pleasant Irish compliment
about his daughter doing everything well.</p>

<p>“She says the lady has such a wonderful
knack, that she must have had
great practice entirely, and ’tis a married
woman she is, with a baby of her
own!”</p>

<p>This was not the description of speech
that Mr. West or any one expected.
He frowned heavily, looked extremely
displeased, and growled out, “I think
the old hag in the corner has been
having some of your brew, Michael,”
whilst the rest of the party set up a
sudden buzz of talking, to hide the unfortunate
remark of the venerable semi-savage.</p>

<p>Poor Miss West! No one ventured
to look at her save Lord Tony. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
had bent her face over the baby, and
her very forehead was crimson.</p>

<p>The captious weather now made a
diversion; it was going to clear. People
began to shake their capes and hats, to
fumble for their gloves. Mrs. Leech—it
was well there was no looking-glass, for
every one was more or less damp and
dishevelled—felt her faultless fringe was
perfectly straight, her feathers in a sort
of pulp, thanks to the torrents upon a
Kerry mountain. The torrents had ceased
entirely, the deceitful sun was shining,
and once more the picnicers sallied forth,
not sorry to breathe a little fresh air.
Mr. West had placed half a crown in
Mrs. Riordan’s hand, and received in
return many blessings; but his daughter
had pressed a whole sovereign into the
infant’s tiny palm, ere she followed her
father and guests over the threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>And now to get home! The short
grass was damp, noisy rivulets trickled
boastfully after the rain, but the mountains
and low country looked like a brilliant,
freshly painted scene: the hills were
gay with gorse, cranberries, and bright
purple heather, and dotted with sheep
and little black cattle. The party now
descended two and two—Lord Tony and
Madeline the last. He was really in love
with this pretty tall girl who walked beside
him, with a deer-stalker cap on her
dark hair, a golf-cape over her graceful
shoulders, and a lovely colour, the result
of rain and wind, in her charming face.
The rain and wind had but enhanced
<i>her</i> beauty. Yes; they would get on
capitally; she would be not only a wife to
be proud of, but a <i>bonne camarade</i>, ever
gay, quick-witted, and good-tempered; a
capital hostess and country gentleman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
helpmate. How well she got over the
ground, how nimbly she scaled the
stiles, and climbed the loose walls without
bringing down half a ton of stones.
Here was another opportunity: speak he
<i>would</i>. Gradually and clumsily he brought
the subject round to the topic nearest
his heart. His speech was half uttered,
when she interrupted him, saying—</p>

<p>“Lord Anthony, I like you very much
as a friend——”</p>

<p>“You need not offer me platonic friendship,
because I won’t have it, and I
don’t believe in it. No,” he began
impetuously. “And if you like me,
I am quite content.”</p>

<p>“Stop! Please let me finish. I like
you so much, that I am going to tell you
a great secret.”</p>

<p>“You are engaged to be married?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“No; I am married already.”</p>

<p>Lord Tony halted. She also came to
a full stop, and they looked at one another
in expressive silence.</p>

<p>She was wonderfully cool, whilst he
was crimson with astonishment; his eyes
dilated, his mouth quivered, his lower
lip dropped.</p>

<p>“You are joking!” he gasped out at last.</p>

<p>“No; indeed I am not.”</p>

<p>“And where is your husband?”</p>

<p>“He is in London. My father does
not know that such a person exists.”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost!”</p>

<p>“No; I have never dared to tell
him yet. I married from school,” she
continued, and in a few hurried sentences
gave the outline of her story,
omitting her husband’s name and profession,
and all reference to her small son.
“You see how I am situated. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
not ventured to tell the truth yet, and
I confide my secret to your honour
and your keeping.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is perfectly safe,” he
began, rather stiffly, “and I feel myself
very much honoured by your confidence,
and all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord Tony, please don’t talk to
me in that tone,” she exclaimed, with
tears in her eyes. “I told you—because—you
are what men call ‘a good sort;’
because I feel that I can rely upon
you; because, though you like me, you
don’t really care for me, you know you
don’t; nor have I ever encouraged you
or any man. My father is devoted to
you; he is determined to—to—well—you
know his wishes—and I want
you to allow him to think that you
have cooled, and have changed your
mind. You—you understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“And play the hypocrite all round!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only for a little while.”</p>

<p>“Rather hard lines, when I have <i>not</i>
changed my mind. Is Rachel in the
swindle?”</p>

<p>“No—oh no!—no one but you and me
and my husband, and a friend of his.”</p>

<p>“And pray, when do you intend to discharge
your little domestic bomb?”</p>

<p>“When I go home. If I were to
speak now, I should be turned out,
probably on the hall door-steps, and the
party would be broken up.”</p>

<p>(Yes, and there were several good days’
deer-stalking still in prospect, thought
Lord Tony, much as he was concerned
at this recent astounding confidence.)</p>

<p>“I know you are dreadfully vexed,”
she said humbly; “but you will forgive
me and stand by me, won’t you?” and
she looked at him appealingly. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
really most lovely and expressive eyes;
who could refuse them anything?</p>

<p>“Meaning, that I am to neglect you
openly, slight you on all occasions?”</p>

<p>“There is a medium; you need not
be <i>too</i> marked in your defection, unless
you like”—with a short, hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>like</i> the job at all; but
I will lend you a hand, and be a
party to the fraud. Whoever is your
husband, Mrs. What’s-your-name, is a
deuced lucky fellow!”</p>

<p>“Then it is a bargain, that you keep
my secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here is my hand on it!”</p>

<p>At this instant (it is constantly the
way) Mr. West paused and looked
behind, and was extremely pleased. He
had intended to shout to this tardy pair
to hurry on, for the carriages were waiting,
the horses, of course, catching cold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
However, he must make allowances, under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Evidently Tony had come to the point
again, and been accepted. He hastened
down the road in great delight, hustled
the company into various vehicles, and
departed in the landau <i>vis-à-vis</i> to Mrs.
Leach (the wretched condition of her
hair and complexion discounted many
delightful recollections of her beauty);
and he took care to leave the <i>dog-cart</i>
behind, for the sole use of the happy
couple.</p>

</div>


<p>It was certainly strange that Lord Tony
had not sought him out the evening after
the picnic, said Mr. West to himself,
considering that it was all settled now.
Indeed, it struck him that his future
son-in-law pointedly avoided him, and
had lounged out of the smoking-room
when he found himself with him alone.
Of course, Lord Tony was aware that his
consent was granted, but he would have
liked him to have come to him at once.
The next day, despite an effort to escape,
Mr. West captured his reluctant quarry
<i>en route</i> to the stables, and said, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
overtook him, rather out of breath,
“Well, my boy, I see you made it all
right yesterday! Why have you not
been to tell the old man—eh?” and he
beamed upon him and poked him playfully
with his cane.</p>

<p>Lord Tony suddenly found himself in
a very nice moral dilemma. Oh! here
was a fix and no mistake!</p>

<p>“There is nothing to tell yet, Mr.
West,” he blurted out.</p>

<p>“What! when I saw you both philandering
behind the party hand-in-hand,
and—and—left you the dog-cart on the
strength of it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I only took Miss West’s hand
for a moment—to—to ratify a promise.”</p>

<p>“Promise of what?” impatiently.</p>

<p>“A promise of her friendship,”
stammered his companion. It was a
moment of mental reservations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” with an expression of deepest
scorn. “That wasn’t the way we made
love when I was a young man. What
a miserable milk-and-watery set you are!
Friendship!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know there is a falling off,”
admitted Lord Tony, with humility.
“But we are not as energetic in any
way as the last generation. We prefer
to take things easy, and to take our own
time. Miss West is young—‘marry in
haste and repent at leisure,’ you know,”
he pursued collectedly. “You must
not rush Miss West, you know. She—she—all
she asks for is <i>time</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did she <i>name</i> any time?”</p>

<p>“Er—well—no.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you mismanaged the business—eh?
You just leave it to me. <i>I’ll</i>
arrange it!”</p>

<p>“No—no—no. That’s just the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
thing I bar. Interference would dish the
whole concern. I beg and implore of
you to leave—a—well alone—for the
present, at any rate. Miss West and I
understand one another.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that; for I’m blessed if
I understand <i>either</i> of you!” exclaimed
his disgusted listener.</p>

<p>“Ah! hullo, there goes Miss Pace,
and I promised to play tennis with her.
I must go and get my bat and shoes.”
Exit.</p>

<p>At the end of September the tide of
enjoyment at Clane was at its height.
Theatricals were in rehearsal—that
fertile field for flirtation and fighting.
The bags of the season had been enviably
heavy; the poor neighbours were sensible
of a pleasant circulation of money and
new ideas; prices were rising steadily.
The wealthy neighbours appreciated Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
West’s princely hospitality, and spoke of
him as “not a bad sort in his way,
though a shocking little bounder.” Mrs.
Leach had prolonged her visit, and her
attentions to her host were becoming
quite remarkable. He was not an ardent
sportsman; his short legs were unaccustomed
to striding over the heather-clad
mountains; he did not want to shoot
deer—in fact, he was rather afraid of them.
So he left the delights of his shooting to
well-contented, keen young men, and was
easily beguiled into long saunters among
the grounds and woods in the syren’s
company. To tell the truth, they were
not much missed, and they frequently
rested on rustic seats, and talked to one
another with apparent confidence—flattering
confidence. He spoke of Madeline’s
future—his earnest desire to see
her suitably married. “A girl like her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
might marry a duke; don’t you think so,
Mrs. Leach?”</p>

<p>“She might,” said the lady, but without
a trace of enthusiasm in her voice—in
fact, there was an inflection of doubt.
“She is undeniably lovely, but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“I—well—I am sentimental” (about
as sentimental as a charwoman), “and
I have my own ideas. I think that dear
Madeline has a private romance: that
she either cares for some one whom she
can never marry——”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” interrupted her
companion, impatiently. “I have her
word of honour that there is no one she
wants to marry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, she may have loved and
<i>lost</i>,” said the lady, sweetly; “for, speaking
as a woman, it is inconceivable that
a girl who is, or was, heart-free could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
absolutely indifferent to <i>every one</i>. She
has dozens of admirers, for she is not
only very pretty, but”—and she smiled
enchantingly into Mr. West’s little eyes—“very
rich—your heiress. It is my
opinion that Madeline has some little
closet in her heart that you have never
seen—that she is constant to some
memory. Of course, time tries all things,
and in time this memory will fade; but
I am positive that dearest Madeline will
not marry for some years.” Then she
tapped his arm playfully. They were
sitting side-by-side in a shady path in
the vast pleasure grounds. “You will
be married before her <i>yourself</i>.”</p>

<p>“I—I—marry! I have never dreamt
of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Why not, pray? You are comparatively
young. A man is always young,
until he is really going downhill. A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
is young at fifty. Now, look at a woman
at fifty!” and she paused expressively.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes upon her. Little
did he suppose that he was contemplating
a woman of fifty—a woman who was
extravagant, luxurious, dreadfully in
debt, almost at the end of her resources
and her friends’ forbearance, and who was
resolved upon marrying him whom she
had once called “that vulgar horror, the
little Australian squatter.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with a rather shame-faced
air and a grin. Alas! flattery
was hurrying him to destruction. She
was an extremely handsome woman,
of the Juno type—erect, stately, with
bright, dark eyes, dark hair, a short
straight nose, and beautiful teeth (some
were her own). She was dressed in a
pale yellow muslin, with white ribbons,
and wore a most fascinating picture-hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
and veil; her gloves, shoes, and sunshade
were of the choicest, and it was not
improbable that, in the coming by-and-by,
Mr. West would have the pleasure of
paying for this charming toilette.</p>

<p>“A woman of fifty,” she pursued, “is
an old hag; her day has gone by, her
hour of retreat has sounded. She is
grey, stout—ten to one, unwieldy—and
dowdy. Now, a <i>man</i> of fifty shoots,
hunts, dances as he did when he was
twenty-five—in fact, as far as dancing
goes, he is thrice as keen as the ordinary
ball-room boy, who simply won’t dance,
and is the despair of hostesses!”</p>

<p>“I’ve never thought of marrying,” he
repeated. “Never!”</p>

<p>“No; all your thoughts are for Madeline,
I am aware, and the alliance she is
to make; but my motto is, ‘Live while
you live; live your own individual life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and don’t starve on the scraps of other
people’s good things.’”</p>

<p>“Do you think any one would have
me, Mrs. Leach?” he asked, as he leant
on his elbow and looked up into her
glorious eyes.</p>

<p>She was the Honourable Mrs. Leach,
well-connected, fashionable, handsome,
and—oh, climax!—“smart.” Yes, the
idea was an illumination. How well she
would look at the head of his table and
in the landau!</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. West, how humble you are!
I am sure you would—(she meant his
money)—make any reasonable woman
happy.” She glanced at him timidly,
and looked down and played coyly with
her châtelaine.</p>

<p>What eyelashes she had, what a small
white ear, what a pretty hand! His own
was already gently laid upon it, the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
were actually on his lips, when a bareheaded
page burst through an adjacent
path, breathless from running. He had
a telegram in his hand, and halted the
moment he caught sight of his master,
who instantly withdrew his hand and
became the alert man of business.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach was a lady, so she was unable
to breathe an oath into her moustache,—had
oaths been her safety-valve. She,
however, thought some hasty thoughts
of round-faced pages who brought telegrams
(which she kept to herself). Mr.
West, however, was not so self-possessed.
As soon as he cast his eyes over the
telegram he gave vent to a loud exclamation
of impatience, and then subsided
into an inarticulate mutter, whilst the page
and the lady devoured him with their eyes!</p>

<p>“Bad news, I’m afraid,” she said sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Um—ah, yes. My stockbroker in
London has made a most confounded
mess of some business. Buys in when
I tell him to sell out. I wish I had him
by the ear this minute.”</p>

<p>“Is there an answer, sir?” asked the
page.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m coming in directly. Tell
the fellow to wait.” And Mr. West and
the handsome widow turned towards the
house.</p>

<p>This vile telegram had entirely distracted
his ideas. His mind was now
fastened on the Stock Exchange, on the
money market; he had not a thought
to spare for the lady beside him.</p>

<p>“It’s the twenty-ninth, is it not?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I must go home sooner than I intended.
I shall have to be in London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
next week. The fox is his own best
messenger” (and the fox was going to
escape!).</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach had intended remaining
in her present comfortable quarters for
another fortnight. This odious telegram
had upset her plans.</p>

<p>“Then, you will not return here?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. What would be the good
of that?”</p>

<p>“It seems a pity. You will be losing
all the lovely autumn tints. October is
a charming month.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it is not charming when
some one at a distance is making ducks
and drakes of your coin, and I’d rather
see the colour of my own money again
than any autumn tint,” was the practical
remark.</p>

<p>“I have had a most delightful visit
here. I shall never, never forget dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Clane, nor all your kindness and hospitality.”</p>

<p>“You must come to us in London.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, and I shall
always be delighted to chaperon dear
Maddie at any time. A girl like her is
in such a difficult position. She is very
young, you know, to go out without a
married lady. Of course, you are a host
in yourself; but——”</p>

<p>“But Lady Rachel and Mrs. Lorraine
take Maddie out, you know,” broke in
Mr. West, “and a girl can go anywhere
with her father.”</p>

<p>“Now there, dear Mr. West, I differ
with you totally—indeed I do. A girl
should have an older woman as well—a
woman for choice who has no young
people of her own, who is well-connected,
well-looking, well-dressed, and who knows
the ropes, as they say.” She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
sketching a portrait of herself. “And
Madeline is so remarkably pretty, too,
the observed of all observers. I am so
fond of her. She <i>is</i> so sweet. I almost
feel as if she were my own daughter.
Ah! I never had a daughter!” (But
she could have a step-daughter; and if
she was once established as Madeline’s
friend and chaperon, the rest would be
an easy matter.)</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to have to leave
Clane sooner than I expected; but business
is business. Business first, pleasure
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“And you have given us all a great
deal of pleasure. I don’t know such a
host anywhere; and it has been such
a comfort to me to talk to you about my
hateful law business, and to tell you things
unreservedly, and consult you. My
odious brother-in-law, Lord Suckington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
never will assist me, and I never
seem to be out of the hands of my
solicitors. Ah, here is your horrid telegraph-boy
waiting. May I go in and
order tea, and pour you out a cup?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In ten days’ time the entire party had
dispersed. Madeline and her father
travelled over to London. As the latter
took leave of Mrs. Leech at Mallow
Junction, and saw her into the Cork
train, that warm-hearted lady, looking
bewitching in a charming travelling-cloak
and hat, leant out of the window and
whispered as she pressed his hand,
“Good-bye, or, rather, <i>au revoir</i>. Be
<i>sure</i> you write to me!”</p>

<p>And was it possible that he had seen
a tear in her eye?</p>

</div>


<p>And meanwhile what of Laurence Wynne?
His short, smart sketches had made a
hit. He was becoming a man of mark
in literary as well as legal circles, and
was overwhelmed with invitations to
dinners, luncheons, and “at homes;” for
be it known that Laurence Wynne was
looked upon with favourable eyes by not
a few mammas and daughters as a clever,
rising, good-looking young bachelor.
Some had heard a vague rumour that
there once upon a time had been a Mrs.
Wynne, a girl whom he had married out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
of a lodging-house or restaurant, but who,
fortunately for him, had died in the first
year of her marriage. Some said this
was not true, some said it was. All
agreed with extraordinary unanimity in
never alluding to Mrs. Wynne in his
company. After all, in these days of
feverish haste, a story is soon forgotten,
and people have too much to do to waste
time in turning over the back pages of
other folks’ lives. The ladies had not
been slow in picking up sundry hints and
allusions to “Wynne,” as dropped across
dinner tables by their husbands and
fathers, and not a few hospitable families
had made up their minds that they would
cultivate Mr. Wynne.</p>

<p>In vain they were assured that he was
not a society man and hated ladies—which,
of course, was nonsense. He
was busy and industrious, that was all;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
and now and then he did come out of
his shell, and sit at their tables, and
stand against the wall at their dances,
and made himself so agreeable that he
was figuratively patted on the back, and
requested to come again; but he so
seldom came again.</p>

<p>It was part of his duty, he told himself,
to be on good terms with his august
seniors—to respond to their first invitations,
to make himself pleasant to their
wives and daughters, hand tea-cups, turn
over music, open doors, talk suitable
commonplaces; but when any of these
same young ladies sat down, so to speak,
before him, and commenced to open the
trenches for a flirtation, he began to
feel uncomfortable. Long ago, before he
met Madeline West, this sort of thing
was well enough—but even then a little
of it had gone a long way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Now, with Madeline in the background,
and amusing herself, no doubt very delightfully,
and not thinking of him, he
could not—no, he could not—like others
less conscientious, laugh and exchange
sallies and cross swords and glances with
any of these pretty, sprightly girls,
knowing full well in his heart that he
was all the time that wolf in sheep’s
clothing—<i>a married man</i>! And then
he was critical at heart, and hard to
please.</p>

<p>As he looked round the various groups
at picnics and tennis parties—he now
and then went for an hour—he saw no
one who approached Madeline in any
way—face, figure, grace, or gait—especially
Madeline as he had last seen her—in
her very fine feathers. Doubtless any
of these girls would have made a more
manageable wife, he thought to himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
bitterly. Yes! she had now taken the bit
completely within her teeth, and he was
powerless to control her. She went and
came and stayed away when she pleased,
and for precisely as long as it suited her.
Her desertion—it was that—was all in
pursuit of his interests—his and the
child’s. What a fool she must think him!
She had evidently resolved to play the <i>rôle</i>
of daughter first, wife next, and mother
very much the last of all! Her neglect
of him he could tolerate, but her neglect
of her child made him excessively angry.
She had wholly consigned it to Mrs.
Holt, and lightly shaken off all a mother’s
duties. She a mother! She did not
look the part as she chattered fashionable
gossip to those idiotic young men
on Euston platform, and never cast a
thought to the infant she was turning
her back on in a certain country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
farmhouse. She had been away nearly
four months, and she had written—oh
yes, pretty frequently, but the tone of her
letters was a little forced, their gaiety
was not natural—perhaps the tone of his
own epistles was somewhat curt. The
relations between Mr. and Mrs. Wynne
were becoming strained—a crisis was
impending.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among the departures from Kingstown
on a certain date were Mr. and Miss
West and suite, who duly arrived at
Belgrave Square, and found London
filling fast. Their arrival, however, was
somewhat unexpected—the housekeeper
had barely time to despatch her sister’s
family back to Manchester, and the poor
woman was compelled to put off an evening
party for which she had issued
invitations among her own set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Mr. West had a great deal of business
to transact, and spent most of his days
in the city—and this was Madeline’s
opportunity.</p>

<p>She lost no time in paying a visit to
the Inner Temple, arriving on foot,
plainly dressed, and wearing a thick veil.
She was a good deal bewildered by the
old courts and passages, but at last discovered
Mr. Wynne’s chambers. Here
she was received by an elderly, bare-armed,
irascible-looking woman—with a
palpable beard—who, after looking her
over leisurely from head to foot, told her
to “Go up to the second flight front.
She could tell nothing of Mr. Wynne; he
was in and out all day, like a dog in a
fair.”</p>

<p>Further up the narrow stairs she came
face-to-face with two gentlemen, who
paused—she felt it—and looked back at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
her as she knocked and rang at the door
of “Mr. Laurence Wynne.” Truly, such
an elegant-looking young lady was not
to be met about the old Temple every
day; and never had such an apparition
been seen on Mr. Wynne’s landing. The
outer room was occupied by two clerks,
who stared at the visitor in unqualified
amazement. Here was something spicy
in the shape of a client! Very, very
different to the usual run. “A breach
of promise,” was their immediate and
mutual idea. Something more to the
purpose than cranky old fogies fighting
about rights of way, or an involved
legacy case. This was a pretty girl,
and a swell.</p>

<p>So much they noted with their
sharp, semi-judicial eyes, as she stood
timidly in the doorway and raised her
veil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>One of them instantly bounded off his
seat, and asked what he could do for
her?</p>

<p>“Could she see Mr. Wynne?” she
faltered, as her eyes roved round the
outer office, with its great double desk
piled with documents, its rows of law
books ranged round the room on staggering,
rickety shelves, its threadbare
carpet, its rusty fender, its grimy windows,
and last, not least, two bottles of
stout, and a pewter mug.</p>

<p>Still, these two youths might be
Laurence’s clerks. Could it be possible?
Could it be possible that these immense
piles of papers concerned Laurence? If
so, he was getting on—really getting on
at last. But what a horrible musty place!
The very air smelt of dust and leather
and law books.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne, miss, did you say? Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
sorry, but Mr. Wynne is in court,” said
the clerk, briskly.</p>

<p>“When will he be back?” she inquired,
advancing and standing in the
front of another door, evidently Mr.
Wynne’s own sanctum.</p>

<p>“Afraid I cannot say, miss; he is to
speak in the case of Fuller <i>v.</i> Potts—breach
of contract. Any business, any
message——”</p>

<p>But the words died upon his lips—this
uncommonly cool young party had
actually walked into Mr. Wynne’s own
sitting-room.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she remarked carelessly,
divining his horror. “Mr. Wynne
knows me.”</p>

<p>And she went and sat down in his
armchair, in front of a table piled with
documents, all more or less neatly tied
up and docketed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>There were numbers of letters under
little weights. There was a law book, a
couple of open notes, and all the apparatus
of a busy legal man. She
shrugged her shoulders and looked round
the room; it was dingy and shabby
(furniture taken at a valuation from the
last tenant); the carpet between the door
and the fireplace was worn threadbare,
as if it were a pathway—which it was.</p>

<p>Another pathway ran from the window
to the wall, which the inmate had probably
paced as he made up his speeches.
There was her especial abomination,
horse-hair furniture, a queer spindle-legged
sideboard, some casual old prints
on the wall; certainly there was nothing
in the room to divert Laurence’s attention.
Outside there was no prospect
beyond a similar set of chambers, a very
ugly block of buildings, and one forlorn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
tree waving its branches restlessly to
and fro.</p>

<p>She got up and glanced into an adjoining
apartment. The clerks were not now
watching her—Mr. Wynne did not
tolerate idleness. This was his bedroom,
a still barer scene. No carpet whatever,
no curtains, a small iron bedstead, a big
bath, a battalion of boots. Laurence,
she remembered, was always extremely
particular about his boots, and <i>hated</i> to
wear them when patched; these were
whole, well cut, and in good case. There
was a sixpenny glass on the wall, a
painted chest of drawers and washstand,
also one chair. Spartan simplicity, indeed!
What a horrible contrast to her
own luxurious home! She closed the
door with a little shudder, and as she did
so a quantity of large, important-looking
cards and envelopes, stuck about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
dusty chimney-piece mirror and the pipe-rack,
caught her eye, and she immediately
proceeded to examine them with
dainty fingers.</p>

<p>“Blest if she ain’t overhauling his invitations!”
exclaimed one of the clerks,
who, by tilting his chair back until it was
at a most hazardous angle, caught a
glimpse of what he and his coadjutor
began to think was “Mr. Wynne’s
young woman.”</p>

<p>“Her cheek beats all! Shall I go and
interfere?” asked the first speaker, in an
awestruck whisper.</p>

<p>“No; you just leave her alone,” said
number two, who had the bump of caution
well developed. “It ain’t our business;
but I <i>did</i> think he was about the last
man in the world to have a lady coming
and routing among his things. There
ain’t nothing that she’ll find as will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
make her any wiser,” he concluded
contemptuously.</p>

<p>But here he was mistaken! She
discovered a great deal that surprised
her much—very much. Here were cards
from old judges and stupid law fogies,
requesting the pleasure of Mr. Wynne’s
company at dinner. That was easily
understood. But there were several
invitations to entertainments to which
she and her father had been bidden!
and also, what was the strangest thing
of all, blazoned cards of invitation to
houses to which her father had not
been able to obtain an <i>entrée</i>, smile he
never so assiduously on the smart or
noble hosts. She stood for several
minutes with one of these precious cards
in her hand, and turned it over reflectively
as she recalled the desperate and
unavailing efforts of her parent to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
a similar honour—the toadying, the
flattery, the back-stair crawling that it
made her crimson to recall! And, such
is poor human nature—poor, frail human
nature!—this bit of pasteboard did more
to raise her husband in her estimation
than all the briefs she saw piled upon
his desk. She now began to contemplate
him from a new point of view. Hitherto
she had been very fond of Laurence—in
a way—her own way. He had been
good to her when she had no friends, he
had borne their poverty with wonderful
patience. Yes, certainly he had. But
she had thought—rather resentfully at
times—that a man without some preparation
for such a rainy day as they had
experienced ought not to have married;
he should have left her as he found her.
She did not hold these views at the time.
She liked Laurence better than any one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
all the same; but the horrible intimacy
of dire want had bred—well, yes, a
little contempt; his illness, his helplessness
had made her put herself somewhat
above him in her own secret thoughts.
She (for a time) had been bread-winner
and house-band, and well and bravely she
had struggled at that desperate crisis;
but, alas! that it must be recorded,
riches had spoiled her. She had inherited
a luxurious, pleasure-loving nature, which
cultivation had fostered, until, from a
small and scarcely noticeable plant, it
had grown into an overwhelming jungle!
The longer she lived in her father’s
home the less disposed was she to
return to her own modest roof-tree; and
especially, looking round with a wry
face, to such a place as this! She was
now necessary to her father. He was
something (he said) of an invalid;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
whilst Laurence was young and strong.
Every day she was hoping to see her way
to making the great disclosure, and every
day the chance of making that disclosure
seemed to become more and more remote.
Laurence was evidently well thought of
in influential circles, and, “of course,
Laurence is of good family. Any one
can see that at a glance,” she mentally
remarked; “and, no doubt, his own
people had now taken him by the
hand.”</p>

<p>The discovery that he moved in a set
above her own had raised him in her
opinion. Latterly she had been looking
down on Laurence, as already stated—perhaps
only an inch or so, but still,
she placed herself above him. He had
drawn a great and unexpected prize in
the matrimonial lottery, but he scarcely
seemed to realize the value of his treasure!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
She had bracketed Laurence mentally
with obscurity, shabbiness, and poverty,
and had a vague idea that only through
her means could he ever emerge into
the sunshine of prosperity. She had
a kind of protecting affection for him,
dating from the days when she had
starved for his sake, and made his bed
and his beef tea, and washed his shirts.
She looked down upon him just a little.
It is possible to be fond of a man and
to entertain this feeling. And now
Laurence’s busy clerks, and these coroneted
envelopes had given her ideas a
<i>shock</i>. She went over and stood in the
window, and drummed idly upon the
small old-fashioned panes, where not a
few names and initials were cut. As
she stood thus—certainly a very pretty
figure to be seen in any one’s window,
much less that of an avowed anchorite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
like Laurence Wynne—a young gentleman
sauntered to the opposite casement,
with his hands in his pockets and his
mouth widely yawning, as if he were on
the point of swallowing up the whole
premises. He paused in mute astonishment,
and gazed incredulously across the
narrow lane that divided the two buildings.
Then Madeline distinctly heard him shout
in a stentorian voice—</p>

<p>“I say, Wallace, come here, quick—quick,
and look at the girl in Wynne’s
window! My wig, ain’t that a joke?”</p>

<p>On hearing this summons she instantly
backed out of sight, and had the amusement
of seeing three heads peering across,
vainly endeavouring to catch a glimpse
of the promised apparition. However,
they saw her depart—although she was
not aware of the fact—and they were
highly pleased with her figure, her walk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and her feet, and took care to tell Mr.
Wynne of their gratifying and flattering
opinion, and to poke him in the ribs
with a walking-stick—not as agreeable
or facetious an action as it sounds—and
to assure him that “he was a sly old
bird, and that still waters run deep, and
that they had no idea he had such good
taste;” all of which witticisms Mr. Wynne
took in anything but good part, especially
as he could not tell them that the lady
upon whom they passed such enthusiastic
encomiums was his wife. Indeed, if he
had done so they would only have roared
with laughter, and flatly refused to believe
him.</p>

<p>Madeline waited three-quarters of an
hour, and then made up her mind to
return home. As she walked through
the outer office, once more thickly veiled,
the alert clerk sprang forward to open the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
door. As he held it back, with an inky
hand, he said, with a benevolent grin—</p>

<p>“When Mr. Wynne comes back, who
shall I say called, miss?”</p>

<p>Madeline hesitated for a moment, and
then, turning to the youth in her most
stately manner, said—“Say Miss West,”
and having thus left her name, with all
due dignity she passed through the door
with a slight inclination of her head and
walked downstairs.</p>

<p>She met a good many cheery-looking
young barristers, in wigs and flyaway
gowns, as she passed through the precincts
of the inns, and wondered if she
would come across Laurence, and if she
would recognize him in that funny dress.
For, of course, he wore a wig and gown
too; but he had always kept them in his
chambers, and she had never seen them.
But she did not meet Laurence—so she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
took a hansom, did a little shopping in
Bond Street, and then got home just in
nice time for afternoon tea.</p>

<p>As she sat sipping it in her luxurious
tea-jacket, and with her feet on the
fender-stool, Mr. Wynne returned home,
tired, hoarse, and cold. His fire was out.
And, moreover, there was no sign of his
modest evening meal.</p>

<p>“Confound that old hag downstairs!”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said one of the clerks
who had been busy locking up, and who
now followed him into his sanctum,
“there was a party to see you while
you were out—a party as waited for a
good bit of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, couldn’t you have dealt
with him?” impatiently. “What did
he want?”</p>

<p>“It was a lady,” impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“A lady!” he echoed. “Oh yes, I
know, old Mrs. Redhead—about that
appeal——”</p>

<p>“No, it was not; it was a young
lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a young lady?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, and she bid me be sure to tell
you,” embroidering a little to give colour
to his story, “as she was very sorry not
to see you, and to say that Miss West
had called.”</p>

<p>“Miss West? Are you sure she said
West?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ll take an oath to it, if
you like.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Yes, yes, it’s all
right. You can go,” dismissing him
with a wave of his arm, and, suddenly
pitching his wig in one direction and
his gown in another, he sat down to
digest the news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>So Madeline had come to beard him
in his den. What did it all mean? and
did she intend to return?</p>

<p>For fully an hour he sat in the
dusk—nay, the darkness—pondering this
question, forgetful of fire, light, and food.
He would have liked to have cross-examined
his clerk as to where she sat,
and what she said; but no, he could not
stoop to that; and then his mind reverted
again to that crucial and as yet unanswered
question—“Did she intend to
come back?”</p>

</div>


<p>Mr. West announced that he was obliged
to run down to Brighton on business and
would not return until late that night,
and he commanded his daughter to write
and ask Lady Rachel to come and lunch,
and spend the day. At lunch time Lady
Rachel duly drove up, and rustled in,
full of gossip, full of vitality, and dressed
out in the last suggestion of the winter’s
fashion. She had a great deal to tell
about a grand dinner at a great house
the previous evening, and retailed volubly
and at length—the <i>menu</i>, the names of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the guests—twenty-six—and the dresses
of the ladies.</p>

<p>“I wore a new frock, rather a daring
style, geranium-red, silk skirt and sleeves,
and a white satin body, veiled in black
net, and embroidered in steel sequins.
But it really <i>was</i> sweet—one of Doucet’s.
I dare not think of the price. However,
it suited me—so my cavalier assured me.”</p>

<p>“You asked him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I did. He was a
barrister. Barristers are looking up!
Yes, another chicken cutlet, please,”
holding out her plate—the Jeameses were
banished. “And such a good-looking
young man—a Mr. Wynne. My dear,
you are giving me oyster sauce!” she
screamed. “What <i>are</i> you thinking
about? And, oh—where was I—what was
I saying? Yes, about Wynne. He was
so amusing, and said such witty things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
I wish I could remember half—nay, any
one of them—and pass them off as my
own. It was more the way he said them,
though. And Madeline, my love,” laying
down her knife and fork, as if suddenly
overwhelmed by the recollection, “he
had the most irresistible dark eyes I
ever looked into!”</p>

<p>“Ever looked into?” repeated Madeline.
“You—you seem quite impressed,” breaking
up her bread rather viciously.</p>

<p>She—no, well she did not like it!
How dared any woman talk of her
husband’s irresistible dark eyes? And
Laurence, had he been flirting? Could
he flirt? Lady Rachel was an irreclaimable
coquette.</p>

<p>“He is coming to dine with us next
Sunday week. I wish you could come too,
and see my new lion. They say he
is awfully clever. Writes such smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
articles, and scarifies us poor women.
The emancipated female is his particular
horror.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! How very pleasant!”</p>

<p>“But men like him, which is always a
good sign. They say he is going into
Parliament some day.”</p>

<p>“If you are going to make a lion of
every one who is said to be going into the
House of Commons, you will be able to
stock every menagerie in Europe,” retorted
Madeline, dusting crumbs off her
lap.</p>

<p>“Or that I shall discover a good many
asses under lions’ skins, eh? I mentioned
you, <i>ma belle</i>, and asked if he had
ever heard of you, and he said yes. See
what it is to be a social celebrity! And
I told him that you were the prettiest
girl and greatest heiress in London—and
that he really <i>ought</i> to know you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“And—and what did he say?” turning
a salt-cellar round and round.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not quite sure what he said
beyond that he was a busy man, and—oh
yes, that he detested the genus heiress.”</p>

<p>And then the vivacious matron led the
conversation away to another topic, and
Madeline led the way to her boudoir.
Presently Lady Rachel announced that
she had an engagement at four o’clock,
and that she could not remain for tea—not
even if Madeline went on her
knees to her, a feat that Maddie had
no desire to perform—and finally she
rushed off in a sort of mild whirlwind of
good-byes, kisses, and last messages—screamed
from the hall and stairs.</p>

<p>Then Madeline sat alone over the fire,
and reflected on what she had heard
with keen discomfort, whilst she stupidly
watched the red coals. Laurence had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
answered her last two letters—he had not
taken any notice of her call. Of course,
he could not come to the house; but at
least he might have written. He had no
right to treat her as if she was a naughty
child. He was entirely relieved of the
burthen of her support; he could start
well and unweighted in the race. She
would pay for Harry too. Her father was
impossible at present; he was dreadfully
worried about money matters—he was ill.
She was doing her best for Laurence and
Harry. Surely, he knew that, and that
she would rather be with them than here.
But as she glanced at her magnificent
surroundings, and at her silver tea
equipage, just brought in by two powdered
servants, with a request to know
“if there were any orders for the
carriage?” her heart misgave her.</p>

<p>Would not Laurence think that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
preferred all this—that this wealth was
her attraction, luxury her idol—an idol
that had cast out him and poor little
Harry?</p>

<p>She made a sudden decision. She
would go and see Laurence. Yes, that
very evening partake of his frugal dinner—a
chop, no doubt—and coax him into
a better frame of mind, and a better
humour with herself. She would wear
her usual evening toilette, and give him
an agreeable surprise. The idea pleased
her. She swallowed down her tea, ran
quickly up to her room, and rang for
Josephine.</p>

<p>“Josephine,” she said, as that very
smart person appeared, “I am going
out to dine with a friend—an old friend
that I knew when I was at school. I
want to look my very best, though it
will not be a party, only one or two.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
What shall I wear?” beginning to pull
off her velvet morning-gown.</p>

<p>“Well, miss, for two or three—a quiet
dinner, but smart no doubt—your primrose
satin with the chiffon body, just
lighted with a few brilliants. I’ll do
your hair in the new knot, and run the
diamond arrow through it.”</p>

<p>This simple toilet occupied a considerable
time. What with dressing Madeline’s
hair, lacing her gown, arranging her
ornaments, it was nearly seven before
the great business was completed; but
it was finished at last, to Josephine’s
entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well, mademoiselle, I never saw you
look better—no, nor as well!”</p>

<p>Madeline could not refrain from a
smile as she glanced at her reflection
in the mirror; but her present sweet
complacency was but momentary. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was a bitter drop in the cup. Was it for
this, asked Madeline—this costly dress,
those diamonds, and such-like delights—that
she sacrificed her home?</p>

<p>“No!” she retorted angrily, aloud,
and much to Josephine’s astonishment.
“No, it is <i>not</i>.”</p>

<p>Yet even so she was but half convinced.
She was presently enveloped in
a long crimson velvet mantle reaching to
the ground, and trimmed with furs that
were as much an outward and visible
sign of Mr. West’s wealth as his house
and carriage—Russian sables. Then she
tied a scarf over her head, took up her fan
and gloves, and, in spite of Josephine’s
almost impassioned appeals to take a
footman and go in the brougham, set
out in a hansom alone. She herself gave
the reply through the trap, in answer to
the “Where to, miss?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>And the attendant footman could not
catch the address.</p>

<p>There was a flavour of wild adventure
about the whole expedition that made
her heart beat unusually fast. The idea
of taking Laurence by storm in his musty
chambers, of cajoling him into a more
amenable frame of mind, of dining with
him <i>tête-à-tête</i>, of trying the effect of her
much-augmented charms upon her own
husband—for she had now fully learnt to
know the value of youth, beauty, and
dress—all carried her away out of her
usual somewhat languorous frame of
mind.</p>

<p>She felt a little nervous as she stepped
out of the hansom in the vicinity of the
gloomy old Temple, and proceeded to
Laurence’s chambers, as before, on
foot.</p>

<p>Fortunately the pavement was dry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
and her dainty shoes were none the
worse.</p>

<p>She came to the door, and rang a pretty
loud peal <i>this</i> time, smiling to herself as
she thought of Laurence sitting over his
solitary meal, probably by the light of an
equally solitary candle.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a curious jerk,
and by some invisible agency, and she
beheld before her, half way up the stairs,
the bearded beldame, carrying a heavy
tray, who, unable to turn her head,
shouted out querulously—“If that’s the
washing, come in. I hope to gracious
you’ve done his shirts a bit better nor
last week. They <i>were</i> a sight; and his
collars! deary, deary me!”</p>

<p>And thus ejaculating, she rounded the
staircase, and was lost to view; but still
she shouted, though her voice did <i>not</i>
come like a falling star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“You can go in by the other door, and
lay them in his bedroom, and leave the
basket.”</p>

<p>Madeline was half suffocated with
suppressed laughter as she tripped
quickly up after this authoritative old
person, and as she went she removed her
head gear, and when she came to the
top landing, she rapidly divested herself
of her long cloak.</p>

<p>The old woman was already in the
outer office, which was lit, and had
deposited her load upon a table when,
hearing a rustle and a footfall, she turned
and beheld Madeline—in other words,
a tall, lovely young lady, wearing a
yellow evening dress, with diamond
buttons, diamonds in her hair, and
carrying a huge painted fan in her exquisitely
gloved hands. No pen could
convey any idea of her amazement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
no brush seize the expression of her
countenance, as she staggered back
against the nearest desk, with limp arms,
protruding eyes, and open mouth, which
presently uttered, in a loud and startled
key, the one word “Laws!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br><span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED HONOUR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A dapper man-servant (hired) next came
upon the scene, and his astonishment was
no less profound, though more skilfully
concealed. He looked politely at Madeline,
and said in his most proper and parrot-like
tone of voice, “Who shall I say,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Say,” returned the young lady, giving
her fringe a little pat, her chiffon frill a
little twitch, and smiling slightly all the
time, “say Miss West.”</p>

<p>“Miss West!” bawled the waiter,
flinging the door open with a violence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
that nearly tore it from its ancient hinges,
and then stood back, eager to witness
the effect of his announcement on the
company.</p>

<p>Madeline was scarcely less surprised
than they were. She beheld a round
table, decorated with flowers, wax
candles, and coloured shades—really, a
most civilized-looking little table—the
room well lit up, its shabbiness concealed
by the tender rose-coloured light,
looking quite venerable and respectable,
and, seated at table, Laurence and two
other men—one of whom she knew!
Horror! This was a great deal more
than she had bargained for. She had
never dreamt of dropping in thus upon
a cosy little bachelor party!</p>

<p>And who shall paint their amazement?
They were talking away, just between
the soup and fish, and Wynne had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
regretting the absence through illness of
Mr. Jessop, whose vacant place awaited
him. There had been a little professional
discussion, an allusion to a big race, a
society scandal, a commendation of some
excellent dry sherry, and they were all
most genial and comfortable, when the
door was flung wide open, and “Miss
West” was announced in a stentorian
voice.</p>

<p>And who the deuce was Miss West?
thought the two guests. All looked up
and beheld a lady—a young lady—in full
evening dress, and literally blazing with
diamonds, standing rather doubtfully just
within the doorway. Laurence Wynne
felt as if he was turned to stone.</p>

<p>“<i>Madeline!</i>” he ejaculated under his
breath. Madeline, looking like a fairy
princess—but surely Madeline gone
mad?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>What could he say—what could he do?
He might cut the Gordian knot by explaining,
“Gentlemen, this beautiful girl,
who has dropped, as it were, from the
skies, is Mrs. Wynne—my wife”—if she
had not heralded her entrance by her
maiden name. He might have done this,
but now, as matters stood, his lips were
sealed. He must take some step immediately.
His friends and the waiter
were staring at him expectantly. They
evidently thought that there had been a
mistake.</p>

<p>“Miss West!” he said, suddenly pushing
back his chair and rising. “This is,
indeed, an unexpected honour. What
can I do for you? There is nothing
wrong at—at home, I hope?” now
approaching her, and shaking hands.</p>

<p>“No, no,” trying to speak calmly, and
casting wildly about for some plausible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
excuse. “I thought I should have
found you alone.” Then, colouring
violently, “I—I mean disengaged, and
I wished to consult you on some—some
family business.”</p>

<p>“If you will honour me by taking a
seat at table, and partaking of our—er—bachelor
fare, Miss West, I shall be entirely
at your service afterwards,” he said,
conducting her to a vacant place opposite
his own. “May I introduce my friend
Mr. Treherne”—(Mr. Treherne had seen
her on the stairs, and hugged himself as
he noted the fact)—“and Mr. Fitzherbert?”</p>

<p>“I think Miss West and I have met
before,” said Mr. Fitzherbert, smiling
and bowing as he rose simultaneously
with Mr. Treherne, and then subsided
into his chair. This was nuts. The
beautiful Miss West coming quite on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the sly to Wynne’s chambers—and Wynne
such a staid and proper Johnnie too!—and
finding, to her horror, company!
It was altogether most peculiar.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Fitzherbert had his wits
about him, and was full of society small-talk
and presence of mind, and soon he
and the lady were conversing vivaciously
of mutual friends, and the awkward edge
of this extraordinary incident had been
blunted.</p>

<p>Soup was brought back for Miss West.
The waiter waited as a waiter should
wait. The dinner was well chosen and
excellent (supplied from a neighbouring
restaurant).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the good laundress watched
the whole proceedings with her eye glued
to a crack in the door, and suffered no
look or gesture to escape her. She owed
this to the whole of her acquaintance, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
surely such a sight as she enjoyed was
rarely seen. Three young bachelors, in
evening dress, sitting by themselves so
nice and proper, and then a grand young
lady, in a beautiful dress and jewels, walking
in unasked, and taking a place among
them! What could it mean? It was
surely not the thing for a lady—and she
looked that—to be coming alone, and
on foot, to chambers in the Temple,
and especially to see Mr. Wynne, of all
the quiet, reasonable-like men, who never
looked at a woman! Oh, it beat all,
that it did! And how grave he seemed,
though he was talking away pleasant
enough.</p>

<p>Thus we leave her, with her eye to the
door, thoroughly enjoying herself for once
in her life.</p>

<p>It was more than could be said for
Laurence Wynne. Never had he felt so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
uncomfortable. What would Fitzherbert
and Treherne think of Miss West? If
the story got round the clubs, Madeline’s
reputation was at the mercy of every old
woman—ay, and old man—in London.
What on earth did she mean by descending
on him at this hour, and dressed
as if she was going to the opera?</p>

<p>He stole a glance across the candle-shades.
She was conversing quite at her
ease with Mr. Treherne, who was looking
all the admiration he no doubt felt—and
no doubt Madeline was beautiful.</p>

<p>What a complexion, what eyes, what
clean-cut features, what a radiant, vivacious
expression—and all set off by
youth, a good milliner, and diamonds.</p>

<p>“Who would dream,” he said, as he
slowly withdrew his gaze, “that she was
the same Madeline who, two years previously,
had been Miss Selina’s slave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and had attracted his notice and commiseration
in her darned and shabby
black gown? or that she was the same
Madeline who had pawned the very dress
off her back not twelve months ago? She
could not be the same.” He looked at
her again. The idea of such a thing was
grotesque nonsense. She, this brilliant
being who had suddenly presented herself
at his humble entertainment, had
surely never been his hard-working,
poverty-stricken, struggling wife. If she
<i>had</i>, he could not realize the fact. This
magnificent-looking young lady was a
stranger to him. This was a woman—or
girl—of the world.</p>

<p>There she sat, this charming, unchaperoned
young person, dining with three
bachelors in the Temple with as much
<i>sangfroid</i> as if it were a most conventional
and everyday occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The truth was that, the first shock
recovered, the fair guest was actually enjoying
herself extremely. She was extraordinarily
adaptable. For one thing,
she liked the <i>risqué</i>, unusual situation—her
two amusing, clever, mystified supporters
on either hand, who were doing
their utmost to take it all as a matter of
course, and to be unusually agreeable and
entertaining. And she liked looking
across the table at her husband’s handsome,
gloomy face, and remarked to herself
that this was positively their first dinner-party,
and that it should not be her fault
if it did not go off well!</p>

<p>Laurence’s silence and gravity implied
that it was all very wrong; but it was,
nevertheless, delightful. She felt quite
carried out of herself with excitement
and high spirits, and more than once the
idea flashed across her mind—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I tell—shall I tell? Oh, it
would be worth anything to see their
faces when they hear that I am Mrs.
Wynne!”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wynne was not very good at
telling, as we know, and, without any
exhausting effort of self-restraint, she
was enabled to hold her peace.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br><span class="small">PLAIN SPEAKING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>All went merry as a marriage bell. The
dinner was a success. There was no
hitch; the laundress (with interludes devoted
to the crack in the door) safely
brought up course after course. Now
they had ceased, and the company were
discussing dessert, and many of the topics
of last season—Henley, Ascot, Mrs. Pat
Campbell, the rival charms of Hurlingham
and Ranelagh.</p>

<p>“Wynne here never goes to these
frivolous places,” said Treherne.</p>

<p>“I’m not a member, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“‘Can’t afford it,’ that’s his cry to all
these delights. He can afford it well—a
single man, no claims on his purse, and
getting such fees.”</p>

<p>“Fees, indeed! How long have I been
getting a fee at all?” he asked good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“There’s Milton, who has not half
your screw—keeps his hunters.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but he has a private income.
I’m a poor man.”</p>

<p>“You old miser! You don’t even
know the meaning of the word ‘poverty.’
How do you define it?”</p>

<p>“In the words of the plebeian philosopher,
‘It ain’t no crime—only an infernal
ill-convenience.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t think it had ever
ill-convenienced you much—eh, Miss
West?”</p>

<p>Miss West—born actress—made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
gesture of airy negation, and, turning
quickly to Mr. Fitzherbert, asked him
“if he remembered Mrs. Veryphast last
season, and her extraordinary costumes.
She quite gloried in her shame, and liked
to know that every eye was fixed upon
her. She had one awful gown—pale
yellow, with enormous spots. She reminded
me of a Noah’s-ark dog. It was
her Sunday frock; but it was not as bad
as her hat, which was like an animated
lobster salad—claws and all.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Fitzherbert had his turn,
and told several anecdotes that had
already seen some service, but which
made Miss West laugh with charming
unrestraint. Presently it occurred to the
two gentlemen guests that the lady had
come for an audience, that it was nearly
nine o’clock, and, making one or more
lame excuses, which, however, were very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
readily accepted, they rose reluctantly,
and, taking a deferential leave of Miss
West, with a “By-bye, old chappie,” to
their host, effected their exit, leaving—had
they but known it—Mr. and Mrs.
Wynne <i>tête-à-tête</i>, alone.</p>

<p>“Well, Laurence,” exclaimed Madeline,
with her usual smiling and <i>insouciant</i>
air, rising slowly, coming to the fire,
and spreading her hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>“Well, Madeline,” he echoed, following
her, laying his arm on the mantelpiece,
and looking as severe as if he were
going to cross-examine a witness. “What
does this mean? Have you gone mad,
or have you come to stay?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” she replied coolly, now
putting an extremely neat little shoe
upon the fender. “Papa is away, and
won’t be back until late, and I took it
into my head that I would come over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
dine with you, and give you an agreeable
surprise; but”—with a laugh—“seemingly
it has been a surprise only; the
word ‘agreeable’ we may leave out.”</p>

<p>“You may,” he said roughly. “I
wonder you have not more sense! If
you had sent me a wire that you were
coming—if you had even had yourself
ushered in under your lawful name; but
to come masquerading here as Miss West
is—is too much, and I tell you plainly,
Madeline, that I won’t have it. What
must those fellows have thought of you
to-night? Fitzherbert will blazon it all
over London. Have you no regard for
your reputation—your good name?”</p>

<p>“There, there, Laurence, my dear,”
raising her hands with a gesture of
graceful deprecation, “that is lecturing
enough—that will do!”</p>

<p>“But it won’t do,” he repeated angrily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
“I really believe that you are beginning to
think of me as a miserable, weak-minded
idiot, who will stand anything. There’s
not another man in England would have
stood as much as I have done, and, by
George! I’ve had enough of it,” with a
wave of his hand in his turn. “This
visit of yours is the last straw. If you
have no regard for Miss West’s reputation,
be good enough to think of <i>mine</i>.
I do not choose to have gaily-dressed
young women coming flaunting to my
humble chambers at any hour of the day.
I’ve been hitherto considered rather a
steady, respectable sort of fellow; I
wonder what people will think of me
now? Your visit will be all over the
Inns to-morrow, and half my circuit will
be clamouring to know ‘who my friend
was?’”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Laurence! What an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
frump you are! Girls do all
sorts of things nowadays, and no one
minds. It is the fashion to be emancipated.
Why, the two De Minxskys go
and dine with men, and do a theatre
afterwards! Chaperons are utterly exploded!
And look at girls over in
America.”</p>

<p>“We are not in America, but London,
where people ask for explanations.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can easily explain <i>me</i>
away! You must be a very bad lawyer
if you are not equal to such a trifling
occasion as this! Oh, my dear Laurence,”
beginning to laugh at the mere recollection,
“I wish you could have seen
your own face when I walked in—a study
in sepia, a nocturne in black. Come,
now, you can tell your anxious friends
that I’m a client, and they will be <i>so</i>
envious; or that I’m your step-sister, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
sister-in-law, or any little fib you fancy.
And as you so seldom have the pleasure
of my society, make much of me”—drawing
forward a chair, and seating herself—“and
tell that old woman of yours to
bring me a cup of coffee.” There was
nothing like taking high ground.</p>

<p>“Yes, presently; but before that there
is something that I wish to say to you,”
also taking a seat. “We won’t have any
more of this shilly-shallying, Madeline.
You will have to make your choice <i>now</i>—to
be either Miss West or Mrs. Wynne,
permanently and publicly.”</p>

<p>A pause, during which a cinder fell out
of the grate, and the clock ticked sixty
seconds. Then Madeline, who would
not have believed, she told herself, that
Laurence could be so shockingly bearish,
plucked up spirit and said—</p>

<p>“I will be both for the present! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
soon I will be Mrs. Wynne only. Papa
is not well now—worried, and very cross.
I began to try and tell him only two
nights ago, and his very look paralyzed
me. I must have a little more time. As
it is, I think, between my visits to the
Holt farm and here, I play my two parts
extremely well!”</p>

<p>“Then you must permit me to differ
with you,” said her husband, in a frosty
voice. “The part of wife, as played for
many months, has certainly been a
farce; but, to put the case in a mild
form, it has not been a success. As to
your <i>rôle</i> of mother, the less said the
better.”</p>

<p>“Laurence”—aghast, and drawing in
her breath—“how can you speak to me
in that way? It is not like you!”</p>

<p>“How do you know what I am like
<i>now</i>? People change. And since <i>you</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
are so much changed, you need not be
astonished if I am changed too!”</p>

<p>“And oh, Laurence, I am so—so angry
with you about one thing!” she exclaimed
irrelevantly. “I went to the
Holts’ on Tuesday and saw Harry; he
looks a perfect little angel!”</p>

<p>“Is that why you are so angry?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Why did you tell Mrs.
Holt to refuse my money? Why may I
not pay for him?”</p>

<p>“Because it is not your affair, but
mine.”</p>

<p>“Not my affair?” she repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>“No; it is my business to maintain my
son. And I shall certainly not suffer him
to be paid for by Mr. West’s money!”</p>

<p>“It is mine; he gives it to me for my
own use.”</p>

<p>“No doubt—to expend in dress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
such things. Not for the support of his
unknown grandchild. You would be
taking his money under false pretences.
Your father pays for his daughter’s expenses;
I pay for my son’s expenses.”</p>

<p>“And I may not?”</p>

<p>“No.” He shook his head curtly.</p>

<p>“But I am his mother!” she said
excitedly.</p>

<p>“I thought you had forgotten that!
Now, look here, Maddie, I am not going
to be put off with words any longer!
You cannot run with the hare and hunt
with the hounds. You must come home
at once. Tell your father the truth, or
let <i>me</i> tell him the truth, and make your
choice once for all. This double life,
where all of it is spent in one sphere, and
only the shadow falls on the other, won’t
do. Think of your child”—with rising
heat—“growing up a stranger to you!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Poor chap! he believes that Mrs. Holt is
his mother. I—I try and see him; but
what good am I? I’m only a man, and
not much of a hand with small children.
Madeline, this cursed money has poisoned
your mind! Admiration has turned your
head. You are no more what you once
were——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say it, Laurence!” she cried,
springing up and laying her head on his
mouth. “I have been waiting, waiting,
waiting, trying to bring my courage to
the sticking-point, and hoping to bring
you and my father quietly together. I see
I have been wrong. I—I will tell him
to-morrow—yes, there is my hand on it;
and if he turns me out, as is most probable,
I shall be sitting here making your tea to-morrow
evening! You believe me, Laurence?”
standing over him as he leant his
head in his hand, and looked into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“There have been so many to-morrows,
Maddie. I’m like the man in the fable
about the boy and the wolves; but”—suddenly
pulling himself together, and
confronting her—“I will believe that
this time it really <i>is</i> wolf.” Standing up
and looking at her, he added, “I will
believe you, and trust you. And now”—ringing
the bell as he spoke—“you shall
have your coffee, and I am going to take
you home in a hansom.”</p>

<p>“Home! It’s too early yet—ten past
nine. Take me to the theatre for an
hour. Take me to the Haymarket; it
will be such fun!”</p>

<p>“Fun!” he echoed impatiently.
“Supposing any one was to see you—any
of your friends—what would they
think? They do not know that I am
your husband; they would only take me
for some admirer, who, presuming on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
your father’s absence, had escorted you to
the theatre, under the rose—that would
be capital fun!”</p>

<p>“What harm would it be? I like
puzzling people. I like to give them
something to talk about,” she answered
recklessly.</p>

<p>“And I do not. And I suppose I know
a little more of the world than you do.
You seem to think it would be a joke to
fling down your good name, and allow it
to be destroyed from pure wantonness,
but I shall not permit it.”</p>

<p>“Laurence how you do talk! One
would think you were addressing a jury,
or were some old fogey laying down the
law!”</p>

<p>“I am laying down the law.”</p>

<p>“You must please remember that I
am accustomed to be spoiled. Now,
<i>my</i> wishes are law in Belgrave Square,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
and you are going to carry them out,
and take me to see ‘The Notorious Mrs.
Ebbsmith.’”</p>

<p>“Take care that you do not become
the notorious Miss West.”</p>

<p>“Now, Laurence, you know you cannot
really say ‘no’ to me. Oh!”—with a
slight start—“here comes the coffee at
last!” as the laundress, who insisted upon
doing this little errand in person, in order
to have what she called “a rare good
look,” fumbled at the door, pushed it
open with her knee, and marched in,
carrying a small tray, which she laid very
slowly on the table, her eyes all the while
being fixed on the beautiful vision standing
by the fire.</p>

<p>She had her face turned away; but
Mr. Wynne, who was leaning his head
on his hand, and his elbow on the mantelpiece,
confronted her steadily and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in a less cordial tone than usual, “There,
Mrs. Potts, that will do! You need not
wait. Call a hansom as soon as you go
downstairs,” and Mrs. Potts very reluctantly
shuffled out. She had seen a good
deal, but was as much at sea as ever.</p>

<p>The young woman had her hand on
Mr. Wynne’s arm when she went in, and
was saying, “you know you cannot say
‘no’ to <i>me</i>, and are going to take me to
the theatre.” Was ever such a brazen
piece! He had his head turned away,
and looked as if he’d rather have her
room than her company. The girls run
after the men now, and no mistake! It
was scandalous! The haystack after the
cow! Supposing this young person’s
folk were to know of her carryings on—and
with Mr. Wynne, of all men! It beat
everything that Mrs. Potts had come
across right away into a cocked hat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>A few minutes later they were coming
down the stairs, miss all wrapped up in
a long velvet cloak, which velvet cloak
Mrs. Potts having found in the outer
office, had done herself the pleasure of
examining, and—low be it spoken—trying
on. None of your “paletot
things,” as she expressed it, but a long
mantle of crimson velvet, reaching down
to the floor, trimmed with thick, soft
fur, and lined with satin, smelling powerfully
of some sweet perfume—violets.
Mrs. Potts, being squat and of short
stature, was lost in it. But the time
when she was enveloped in a six-hundred-pound
wrap was indisputably one of her
happiest moments. There was a pocket
inside, and in that pocket a dainty lace-edged
handkerchief, which, I am sorry
to say, Mrs. Potts felt called upon to
confiscate as a souvenir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>It did not appear to be one of Mr.
Wynne’s happiest moments, as he pulled
on his great coat, and followed the
daintily tripping, high-heeled steps of
his visitor downstairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Potts, who had naturally hung
about the door below, did herself the
honour of seeing the couple into the
hansom, and heard the order—“Haymarket
theatre.”</p>

<p>“So she had got her way,” said the
charwoman, as she stood boldly in the
doorway and looked after them. Then
she went upstairs to Mr. Wynne’s room
and finished the sherry, poured herself
out a cup of coffee, which she sipped
at her leisure, as she sat comfortably
over the fire in Mr. Wynne’s own chair.
One half of the world certainly does not
know how the other half lives!</p>

<p>“Really, it is very ridiculous of you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
to be so strait-laced and grumpy,
Laurence!” said his wife. “Think of all
I am going to relinquish for your sake!”—touching
her furs. “This mantle,
which makes other women green with
envy, cost nearly six hundred pounds!”</p>

<p>“Six hundred fiddlesticks!” he echoed
incredulously.</p>

<p>“You can see the bill, if you like.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed to wear
it, Maddie!”</p>

<p>“Not at all, my dear. It is for the
good of trade. If some people did not
buy and wear fine feathers, what would
become of trade?”</p>

<p>“Six hundred pounds! More than
he could earn in twelve months! And
she paid that for an opera-cloak!”</p>

<p>“You really must make yourself
agreeable, Laurence. This may be the
last time I shall play the fairy princess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
before I go back to my rags. No, no,
I don’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“Something tells me, all the same,
that this will not be your last appearance
in your present character. Not that I
question for a moment your good intentions,
Maddie, or disbelieve your
word. But I have a presentiment—a
sort of depressing sensation that I
cannot account for—that, far from your
returning home to-morrow, our lives
will somehow have drifted farther apart
than ever.”</p>

<p>“Fancy a clever man like you, dear,
believing in such foolish things as
presentiments! They are merely remnants
of the dark ages. I hope we
shall be able to get a box,” she added,
as they drew up at the theatre, “no
matter how tiny; a stall would be too
conspicuous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>The Wynnes were late. The orchestra
was playing during an interval, and they
had the great good luck to secure a box
overlooking the stage.</p>

<p>Madeline removed her mantle, and,
taking a seat with her back to the house,
having glanced round with affected
nervousness, said to her companion, in
a smothered whisper—</p>

<p>“Sister Ann, Sister Ann! do you see
anybody looking? Do you think any
one recognized me by my back hair?”</p>

<p>Laurence had noted several familiar
faces; and one man in an opposite box
had recognized him. But this was of
no importance, as he could not possibly
identify Madeline.</p>

<p>Madeline whispered and laughed and
chattered to him behind her fan. He
told himself that he was a sour, sulky
brute to be so gruff and irresponsive to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
the beautiful girl opposite to him,
although he could hardly realize that
she was his wife as he glanced at her
at this special moment, as she sat with
her head resting on her hand, diamonds
glittering on her gown and in her hair,
a gay smile on her lips, no wedding-ring
on her finger. Could this really be
Madeline West, Mrs. Harper’s pupil-teacher,
and his wife?</p>

<p>His acquaintance in the opposite box
was astonished to see Wynne over against
him. Surely it was not to another man
that he was thus bending forward and
stooping his head so politely, as if to
lose nothing of what was being told
him! Ah, no—he thought not! as
presently a very pretty hand, wrist,
and arm emerged from the shadow of
the curtain, and lay upon the velvet
cushion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>He snatched up his excellent opera-glass,
and noted a sparkling bracelet and
diamond rings. But no—there was not
a wedding-ring amongst them!</p>

</div>


<p>When the play was over the Wynnes
prudently waited, and were almost the
last to leave. But, even so, when they
passed through the lobbies, a good many
people were still to be seen. They
were a rather remarkable couple, and
although Madeline had drawn her lace
scarf well over her head, it was of no
avail. On the stairs she came face to
face with Lord Tony.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he exclaimed, as he accosted
her. “I did not know you were coming
here to-night. Rachel told me she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
lunched with you to-day, and you were
alone in your glory. Whom did you
come with?” And he looked as if
he was expecting to see some of the
party.</p>

<p>“I came in very good company,” she
replied. “But, pray, who made <i>you</i> my
father confessor?”</p>

<p>“I only wish I was! Are you going
on to supper at the Candy-tufts? If so,
we shall meet again.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going home this moment.”</p>

<p>“How virtuous! Well, you’ll be in
the Row to-morrow—riding—at the
usual hour?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for you about ten.
Good night.” And he hurried off.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” inquired Laurence.</p>

<p>“Oh, a great friend of papa’s—Lord
Anthony Foster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed! I shouldn’t have thought
they had many tastes in common.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate they have <i>one</i>,”
she answered, with a flippant laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, dense as I am, I think I can
guess it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne was also recognized by
several of his own friends. Why is it that
there is always some one to see you when
you wish to escape notice, and, when you
particularly desire to court observation,
there is never any one forthcoming?</p>

<p>No; and yet if you lose a front tooth,
and, with a gaping chasm in your neat
front row, are <i>en route</i> to the dentist, you
are bound to encounter half your acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. FitzHerbert and Mr. Treherne
were standing on the steps as their
friend passed, and wished him a cheerful
good night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>He did not accompany Madeline; she
would not permit it. She must get home
at once, before her father returned, she
whispered; “and supposing she were seen
driving up, escorted by a gentleman, a
stranger!”</p>

<p>“All right, all right, Maddie,” wringing
her hand. “But, mind you, it is the
last time. Remember, to-morrow! Send
me a wire, and I shall come and fetch
you.”</p>

<p>Then, with a gesture of farewell, he
stepped back, and she was quickly whirled
away.</p>

<p>Mr. FitzHerbert and Mr. Treherne
were still endeavouring to light up, and
had not yet started to walk; the night
was fine and frosty, and they had not far
to go.</p>

<p>“I’m coming your way. Hold on a
minute till I get out my cigar-case,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
said their late host. And soon the trio
were facing homewards, discussing the
piece, the actresses, the audience; but
not a word dropped from either gentleman’s
lips with regard to Wynne’s
mysterious lady friend, though, like the
celebrated parrot, they thought the more.
Wynne was a reserved sort of chap. For
nearly a year he had dropped out of their
ken. Jessop alone was his confidential
friend. None ever dreamt of poking
their noses into his affairs, as a caustic
reply, or a painful snub was sure to
be the reward of the experiment. He
was of good family—that they knew;
and latterly some of his influential
relations had been looking him up.
(Nothing succeeds like success, and the
brilliant author of society skits was now
eagerly claimed by his connections.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
anxious to know more respecting Miss
West, the gay vivacious beauty, whose
fame had spread far and wide, whose
riches and whose disheartening indifference
to the advances of the most
eligible <i>partis</i> were alike proverbial.</p>

<p>What on earth had she to do with a
hard-working barrister like Wynne, who
rarely mixed in society? They asked
each other this question after they had
left Wynne and his client <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
“Business?”</p>

<p>It was confoundedly odd that she should
pitch on such an hour, and on such an
uncommonly handsome fellow as Wynne
for her legal adviser; and the funniest
part of it all was, that Wynne was not
particularly pleased to see her, and
treated her as coolly as if she had been
his grand-aunt by marriage! Talking of
matters far different from their inmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
thoughts brought the trio to Mr.
Treherne’s chambers.</p>

<p>“Come up, you fellows, and have some
devilled bones,” he said hospitably;
“the night is young!”</p>

<p>Mr. FitzHerbert never turned a deaf
ear to such an appeal, but Wynne on
this occasion, rather to his friend’s
surprise, said, “All right, I’ll come up
for a minute,” and sprang up the stairs
two steps at a time.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay,” he said,
taking off his hat and standing with
his back to the fire, still in his top coat;
“but I’ve just wished to have a word
with you two fellows. I want to ask you,
as a special favour to <i>me</i>, to say nothing
to any one of having met Miss West in
my chambers.”</p>

<p>The two guests muttered, “Oh, of course
not; certainly not;” but without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
great alacrity. This demand was decidedly
a blow, for they were only human, and
were looking forward to describing the
scene with pleasurable anticipation.</p>

<p>“When I ask you to do me this
favour,” he resumed, as coolly as if he
were speaking in court, “I think it
only fair to take you into my confidence,
and to tell you our secret. Miss West
and I were married nearly two years ago.
<i>She is my wife.</i>”</p>

<p>And putting on his hat, he nodded
good night with the utmost <i>sangfroid</i>,
and ere they could get out one single
syllable, much less question, he was
already at the bottom of the last flight of
stairs.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br><span class="small">A PROMISE POSTPONED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“A telegram for you, sir,” said one of
the clerks to Laurence Wynne, the
following morning. Telegrams were a
common arrival; but instinctively he felt
that there was something unusual about
this one, as he tore it open and glanced
over it.</p>

<p>“My father is dangerously ill. Impossible
to fulfil promise. Writing.”</p>

<p>“I knew it,” he said, as he crumpled
the paper in his hand, then smoothed
it and read it over again. “No,” to the
clerk, who had a bet on an imminent big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
race, and had gathered alarm from Mr.
Wynne’s expression; “no, Stevens; there
is no answer.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Mr. West had come in and gone to
bed,” so Miss West was impressively
informed by the butler. Yes, he had
inquired for her, and he had told him
that, to the best of his belief, she was
spending the evening with Lady Rachel.</p>

<p>Madeline breathed again freely, and
hurried up to her own room, almost
afraid of encountering her fussy and
inquisitive parent on the stairs, and
being rigidly questioned then and there.</p>

<p>But Mr. West had not been feeling
well, and complained of his chest and
breathing, and had gone straight to bed,
so said Josephine. Consequently there
was no chance of his loitering about in
passages, awaiting her, and catching cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Madeline sat over her fire, for a long
time, wondering how she could bring herself
to tell him, and what would be the
result of her great piece of news. It must
be told—and told to-morrow; Laurence
was evidently serious. She had not known
till now that Laurence could be hard,
stern, and immovable. Well—well—she
wished the ordeal was over, and well
over; this time to-morrow it would be a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, nay, most likely,” she said
to herself half-aloud, “this is the very last
time I shall sit at this fire; the last time
I shall have a maid to lay out my things
and brush my hair. Heigho! I wish—no—no—I
don’t wish I had not married
Laurence, but there is no harm in wishing
that he was <i>rich</i>!”</p>

<p>Madeline’s terror of her inevitable
interview kept her awake for hours; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
heart beat so loudly, that it would not
suffer her to sleep, and it was really
morning when she fell into a troubled
doze, from which she was aroused by
Josephine with an unusually long face,
and no morning tea in her hand.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” she said, “your
father is very ill, so his man says.
The doctor has been sent for. They
think he has got inflammation of the
lungs.”</p>

<p>Madeline sprang out of bed, huddled
on some clothes, and went at once to her
parent’s room. He was very ill—in high
fever, his breath coming in quick labouring
gasps. It was, as Josephine had
said, inflammation of the lungs, and the
doctor added, “a very sharp attack.”
It had come to a crisis with extraordinary
rapidity. It was, he admitted, a grave
case; he would like another opinion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
two hospital nurses must be procured at
once. How quickly every alleviation,
every possible remedy for sickness, every
luxury, flows into a rich man’s sick-room!</p>

<p>Was he dangerously ill? asked
Madeline, with bated breath.</p>

<p>“Well, there was always a danger in
these sudden attacks, and Mr. West had
lived a hard life and taken an immensity
of wear and tear out of his nerves and
vitality. His heart was weak; but still,
he had pulled people through worse cases,
and she must not think that because her
father was seriously ill he was bound to—to——”
and he left her to fill in the
blank herself, not wishing to hint at that
ugly word—death.</p>

<p>And thus was Madeline’s confession
postponed <i>sine die</i>, and Madeline felt
that she had been reprieved. Yes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
personal fascination of Laurence’s presence
had already faded. She wrote a
long affectionate letter, and explained the
state of the case to Laurence, and sent
him constant bulletins of her father’s
progress, and except for one flying visit
to the Holt Farm and once to church on
Sundays, she never left the house for the
whole month of November. However,
she was cheered in her monotonous duties
by the company of Mrs. Leach, who, on
hearing of dear Mr. West’s illness, had
written from Brighton and volunteered
her services to her darling Madeline.
Then she had arrived in person, and
urged her request with persistence. She
would look after the house, see callers,
write notes, and leave Madeline unlimited
time to spend with the dear invalid.</p>

<p>At first Mr. West, fretful and weary,
would not hear of her arrangement. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
was one thing to look into the fair
widow’s eyes and hold her hand and
listen to her flatteries, when in good
health, on an idle autumn day; it was
another to have her coming and quartering
herself thus on a sick house. However,
after many messages and intrigues
and excuses, Madeline gave way. She
was weak, the besieger was strong, and
she begged her father to accept the
proffered favour.</p>

<p>“I cannot get rid of her, dear. She is
determined to come, and, after all, you
won’t see her, you know.” But here she
reckoned without her guest.</p>

<p>In less than a week Mrs. Leach was
frequently smoothing the sick man’s
pillow. She paid him a little visit daily,
to which he actually looked forward. She
told him all the latest news, she flattered
him, and she made an agreeable object in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the sick-room, with her charming gowns
and handsome face.</p>

<p>After all, she took no part in the
management of the house, nor did she see
visitors, or write notes. She was (she
said) so stupid about domestic matters.
It seemed to Madeline that their pre-arranged
<i>rôles</i> were exchanged; she kept
to her usual duties as housekeeper and
mistress of the establishment, and Mrs.
Leach gave more and more of her time
to the sick-room. She had a pleasant
voice which never tired, and read aloud
to the invalid for hours. She made him
his afternoon tea with her own fair hands,
and always took a cup with him. Indeed
Mrs. Leach cruelly maligned herself when
she called herself stupid; on the contrary,
she was an excessively clever woman,
twice as worldly wise as her pretty
Madeline. In her heart of hearts, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
had determined to be Madeline’s stepmother;
but Madeline must marry, she
would prefer the house to herself, and
she looked round the gorgeous yellow
drawing-room with the air of a proprietor,
and indeed had already mentally altered
the arrangement of the furniture! Why
did not Madeline accept one of the gilded
youths who fluttered round her? There
was some story in Madeline’s past, and if
she could not steal the key to her skeleton
cupboard, she was determined to pick the
lock, for she had had a glimpse through
the keyhole—and there <i>was</i> something
inside! This glimpse had been afforded
her by means of a young lady who had
stayed at the same hotel at Harrogate,
a Miss De Ville, who had been for several
years at the same school as the lovely
Miss West. Crafty Mrs. Leach affected
a very faint acquaintance with Miss West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
but a very warm interest in Miss De Ville
and her school days, and even went so far
as to ask her in to tea in her own little
sitting-room, and showed her the photographs
of her cousins, the Countess of
Cabinteely and the Honourable Mrs.
Greene-Pease.</p>

<p>“And so you were at school with
Madeline West, the Australian heiress?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, for several years; the last year
and a half she was a pauper—a pupil-teacher
who received no pay—and I do
believe wore Miss Selina’s old shoes.”</p>

<p>“How extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“Yes; her father never paid for her,
though for years before he had paid very
highly. She learnt everything, even
swimming and riding, and had most
lovely clothes. Then he disappeared.
However, he has bobbed up again with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
quantities of money, by all accounts—<i>at
present</i>.”</p>

<p>“And when he came home was he
not ashamed of himself? What excuse
had he when he found his daughter
in such a condition?” demanded Mrs.
Leach.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; he <i>did</i> find her there.
But this is the funny thing: she had
been sent away in <i>disgrace</i>, so it was
whispered, one Christmas holidays, and
was absent for a good while.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach opened her great dark eyes
and exclaimed, “Good gracious! Where
was she? What had she done?”</p>

<p>“Well, it happened in the holidays,
you see, and just afterwards there was a
great piece of fuss about Miss Selina’s
marriage and quarrel with Mrs. Harper,
so that put the thing aside; but we did
hear through the servants,” and here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
she had the grace to redden, “that Miss
West had ran away from school.”</p>

<p>“And was that all?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Leach, don’t you think
it a good deal?”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course!” impatiently,
“shocking, abominable! But were there
no details and no particulars—no reason
given for her escapade?”</p>

<p>“No; and Mrs. Harper and Miss
Letitia, when I asked them plump out
one day, when I was staying in the
neighbourhood and was having supper
with them, denied it most emphatically.
They were quite <i>angry</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Mrs. Leach, with a
gasp of disappointment. “Hushed it up
for the credit of the school, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, they said Miss Selina had made
dreadful mischief, and been the cause of
Madeline being sent away for a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
time; but we have never heard Miss
Selina’s version of the story,” she added
expressively.</p>

<p>“Where is <i>she</i> now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she married a clergyman much
younger than herself, and has gone to
the South Sea islands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, well out of the way. And are
you intimate with Miss West?”</p>

<p>“No; we had a quarrel the last year
she was at school with me, and did not
speak for months.”</p>

<p>“What was it about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, something trivial—hairpins, I
think, or not passing the butter; but I
never really liked her. Still, for old
times’ sake, I have sometimes thought
of calling. My aunt, Lady Mac Weasle,
knows her, and says the Wests give
magnificent entertainments and go everywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her driving in the Park,
beautifully dressed; but I am sure she is
painted. Perhaps some day I shall call,
or rather get my aunt to take me.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, there is the first dressing-bell,
so I must send you away. Good-bye,
for the present. I have enjoyed this
little chat so much, you have such a way
of interesting one.” And really, for once,
Mrs. Leach was speaking the pure and
unadulterated truth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br><span class="small">A PORTIÈRE WHICH INTERVENED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. West was ably nursed, he was wiry,
and he struggled back to a most trying,
peevish convalescence, greatly hastened
by Mrs. Leach’s assiduous attentions;
and early in January he was ordered off
to the Riviera without delay. He was
to go to Nice, and, of course, he was
not to go alone. Madeline would accompany
him. What would Laurence say
to this?</p>

<p>In her father’s present precarious state
of health, she dared not tell him her
news, it would be too great a shock;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and yet she almost dreaded facing her
husband with another excuse.</p>

<p>Laurence was not to be trifled with,
still less her father. What an unlucky
creature she was! she said to herself
tearfully.</p>

<p>Between these two men, who had such
claims upon her, what was she to do?
Which was to be sacrificed, father or
husband? And then there was little
Harry.</p>

<p>And yet her father clung to her as
tenaciously, as if he were a child, and
could scarcely endure her out of his
sight.</p>

<p>Circumstances put tremendous pressure
upon her, circumstances in the
shape of doctors, her father, and her
fears; and she allowed herself, as usual,
to drift.</p>

<p>It was quite settled that she was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
go to Nice—in fact, there had never been
any question of her remaining behind—and
to stay there until May. She had
no alternative in the character of Miss
West, go she must; but in her character
of Mrs. Wynne, how was she
to act? What about her husband and
son?</p>

<p>She dared not again venture a visit to
the Temple, so she wrote a very loving
pleading little letter, putting everything
before Laurence in the best and strongest
light, as seen from her own point of
view, and imploring him to be patient
just a little longer, until her father was
well enough to hear the shock—and to
live without her. To this letter she
received no reply for ten days.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Jessop called; he was an
occasional visitor at Belgrave Square.
He felt a certain cynical pleasure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
watching both “hands” in this curious
game. It was ten times more interesting
than the best novel going, or even the
latest society play, so he told himself.
To see little—no, she was not little,
but young—Mrs. Wynne once, and to
see her as she was now, was indeed a
most startling contrast. To see Laurence
working away like a horse in a mill, was
another fine sight. And to behold a
couple, once so devoted, so absolutely
indifferent to one another, so totally
divided by that great gulf, wealth, was
the strangest spectacle of all!</p>

<p>Mr. Jessop occasionally dropped in on
a Sunday afternoon, and paid his respects
to Miss West and her father. A short
time before their departure for the sunny
South, he called to take leave and wish
them “bon voyage.” It was one gloomy
January afternoon. Mr. West was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
visible, but Miss West received him and
various other visitors in a snug, warm
little drawing-room, one of a suite where
she dispensed small talk, smiles, and
afternoon tea. Mr. Jessop sat out all
the other visitors with imperturbable
resolution, and when the last had risen
and departed, he brought his chair nearer
to the fire, unasked, crossed his long legs,
stuck his glass in his eye, and, after a
momentary pause, said—</p>

<p>“And how does Laurence look upon
this little expedition of yours?”</p>

<p>“He has not answered my letter; but,
you know, silence gives consent,” was
the smiling response. “Are you surprised?”
and she awaited his verdict
with smiling, upraised eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, frankly, I am.”</p>

<p>“You, under similar circumstances,
would not be so complacent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“No; I should probably be up before
the ‘beak’ for wife-beating.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jessop!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wynne!”</p>

<p>“Hu-s-sh!” with a quick gesture of
dismay.</p>

<p>“Well, I will ‘hu-s-sh!’ as you wish
it; but it will be shouted on the housetops
some day. How you have kept the
secret for so long amazes me; even
Wynne’s old friends don’t know of your
existence. His own distant relations
have actually reinstated him. They
believe that he made a fool of himself
with a penniless shop-girl or teacher,
and is now a <i>not</i> disconsolate widower!”</p>

<p>This was a very nasty speech; but Mr.
Jessop was in a bad humour. When he
looked round this luxurious abode, and had
seen Mrs. Wynne receiving homage and
dispensing favours among a little court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
and then recalled his old schoolfellow’s
quarters, his ascetic life, his laborious
days—his heart became hot within him.</p>

<p>“Why do you say such horrid things?”
she asked petulantly.</p>

<p>“When did you see Laurence last?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not seen him for ages—centuries!
Not since I dined with him in
his chambers. I walked in and found
him entertaining two men. Oh, I wish
I could draw their faces!”</p>

<p>“I wish you could! I heard of that.
You gave the staircase something to talk
about. Laurence is on circuit now. I
dined with him a couple of weeks ago.
He is working very hard—too hard; but
he won’t mind any one. I must say you
are a pretty pair!”</p>

<p>“Thank you; it is not often that <i>you</i>
pay me a compliment!” she returned,
with a bend of her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“And Harry?”</p>

<p>“He is very well.”</p>

<p>“I must run down and see him when I
can, as one of the duties of a godfather.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is growing quite a big boy,
and will soon be able to use your knife
and fork.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it; but I should
have thought he wanted some teeth
first!” Then, as a clock chimed,
“Hullo! that is half-past six, and I
must go; and you are off next week, and
go straight through to Nice <i>wagon de
luxe</i>, and all that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” with a slightly defiant
smile.</p>

<p>“Have you any message for <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I’m afraid you would
be an indifferent Mercury. No, I have
no message. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>They shook hands rather limply, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
he took leave. As the door closed on
Mr. Jessop she gave a long sigh of relief,
and was about to reseat herself, when her
quick ear caught a sound behind a heavy
velvet <i>portière</i> which divided the room
from an inner sanctum; it was the sound
of the dropping of a small article, such
as a bangle or thimble, on the parquet.
Prompted by a sudden and inexplicable
impulse, she pulled aside the curtain,
and Mrs. Leach, with a blotter in her
hand and an expression of embarrassment
on her face, stood revealed.</p>

<p>“I—I—was writing in there, dear,
some urgent notes, and I have dropped
my pet pen. It is one I am so fond of.
Do help me to look for it, darling.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach was inclined to embonpoint
and rather stiff.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is easily found!” said Madeline,
picking it up after a moment’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
search. As she handed it to its owner,
who had now advanced to the full light,
their eyes met. Madeline read in those
uneasy, slyly scanning orbs that their
owner had her suspicions, that this
smiling widow had been listening behind
the <i>portière</i>. Should she tax her or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. Leach was an adept at reading
faces. She saw that Madeline distrusted
her smooth lies, that Madeline was
secretly terrified, that Madeline was
eagerly searching her mind as to what
she could possibly have heard; that it
was a critical moment. Accordingly
she made a bold move.</p>

<p>“I know what you think, dear,” she
said, coming up to the fire and warming
one foot—“you think I have been unintentionally
eavesdropping.”</p>

<p>She had been eagerly listening, with
every nerve strained, for ten whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
minutes; but, alas! the <i>portière</i> was very
thick, the sounds were muffled, and she
had, unfortunately, caught no names.
She was certain that she had been in
every sense on the threshold of dear
Madeline’s secret; but, alas! she had not
got beyond that; had only caught a word
here and there. The word “Hush!”
something about “shop girl,” and “a
widower;” something about “a staircase,”
and a “compliment;” something
about “a knife and fork,” and, lastly, two
whole sentences, “How you have kept
the secret for so long amazes me!”
and “Have you any message for him?”</p>

<p>Whoever this <i>him</i> was, he was Miss
West’s lover, the man whose influence
enabled her to turn a deaf ear to every
other suitor. Presumably he was not
presentable. If Madeline would but
marry him, or elope with him, the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
would be open to her, she would easily
step into her place. The main thing
was to lull Madeline’s suspicions, to give
her plenty of rope—in other words, opportunities
for meetings—to pretend to see
nothing, yet to allow nothing to escape
her vigilance. This man—his name was
Jessop—was in Madeline’s secret, the
secret she had kept so amazingly! If
she played her cards properly, she, too,
would soon share it!</p>

<p>“I declare I did not hear a single
word. I am a little deaf since I had the
influenza; so whatever you were talking
about is perfectly safe as far as <i>I</i> am
concerned.”</p>

<p>Madeline made no reply, but came and
stood before the fire, and her pretty,
level brows were knit. She was endeavouring
to recall her recent conversation,
and as well as she could recollect, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
had said <i>nothing</i> that incriminated her.
She breathed more freely. The <i>portière
was</i> thick—it was wadded; but, all the
same, she did not believe her fair companion.
Her mouth said smooth things;
but her eyes had told tales. Her suspicions
were aroused; but she, too, could
play a part.</p>

<p>“Of course; no lady ever lends herself
to eavesdropping, I know,” she said
quietly. “Mr. Jessop and I were merely
quarrelling; we often quarrel. He has a
knack of rubbing people up the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Jessop! is <i>that</i> his name?
He is a most cynical, disagreeable-looking
man. When did you first meet him,
dear?”</p>

<p>“He called on me.” She did not add
where—viz. in Solferino Place. “He is
rather amusing when he is in a good
humour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“What is he?”</p>

<p>“A barrister; a clever, idle barrister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is he a barrister? Do you know,
I rather like them. I wonder if he would
take us over one of the inns, and to see
the Law Courts and Temple? Wouldn’t
you like to see it, some day?”</p>

<p>“No. I don’t think I should care
much about it,” rejoined Madeline with
studied indifference.</p>

<p>Could—oh, could Mrs. Leach have
guessed anything? At any rate, she was
getting <i>hot</i>, as they say in magic music;
and, to put an end to such hazardous
conversation, she went over to the piano
and began to play a little thing of Grieg’s.
Now that she suspected Mrs. Leach—handsome,
well-mannered, charming,
low-voiced Mrs. Leach—of wishing to
play the spy, her terrified memory recalled
many little items which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
pieced together: how Mrs. Leach had
a careless way of looking over all the
letters, of hearing two conversations at
the same time, of asking strange and
seemingly stupid questions—especially
about the last years of her residence at
Harperton!</p>

<p>In the early days of Mr. West’s convalescence,
when his appearance downstairs
and his temper had been somewhat fitful,
Madeline found herself one afternoon
alone in the library with Lord Toby.
He was talking of the theatres, and
urging her to accompany him and Lady
Rachel to the Haymarket.</p>

<p>“This beastly snow has stopped the
hunting, and there is nothing to do but
skate and go to the play. Why can’t
you come to-night? Your father is
pretty nearly all right; and Mrs. Leach
will look after him. It’s a capital piece.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Oh, I forgot!” and he paused; he had
been walking to and fro, with his hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Forgot what?” looking up from her
embroidery.</p>

<p>“That you’d seen it before.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked,
gazing at him with dispassionate calm.</p>

<p>“I mean that I saw you there, now I
remember; but I didn’t see your chaperon!
You needn’t look so stunned;
you were with a good-looking chap, in
a stage box. You sat with your back
to the audience, too.”</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you talking about?”</p>

<p>“And you appeared to be delighted
with the piece; but I thought your
friend seemed a little bored. And, don’t
you remember, I spoke to you in the
vestibule? Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! Looked rather bored, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
he? Then surely you can <i>guess</i> who he
was!” now smiling expressively.</p>

<p>“Not”—coming to a standstill—“not
your——”</p>

<p>“Hush! Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>am</i> blessed! He is a gentleman,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I must tell him; he
will be <i>so</i> pleased.”</p>

<p>“I mean that he looks clean-bred; not
like——” and he stopped. “Of course
I can easily find out who he is; but,
honour bright, I won’t! I will forbear.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll take pity on your starving
curiosity. His name is Wynne.”</p>

<p>“What, the writing chap?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you are Mrs. Wynne?”</p>

<p>“I am under that impression.”</p>

<p>“He must be a long-suffering sort of
fellow, or——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“Or what?”</p>

<p>“I was going to say something that
<i>might</i> sound rude.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray don’t hesitate on my account!
I’ve often heard you say rude
things; and one speech more or less
does not signify.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it may serve as a slight
antidote to the large doses of flattery you
are forced to swallow.”</p>

<p>“Come! Or <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p>“I was going to say, he does not care a
rap about you. It’s a little way married
men have, particularly in these days of
emancipated womankind—especially
wives. Does he care, Mrs. Wynne?”</p>

<p>“You want to know too much,” she
answered, without raising her eyes.
“Some day I shall make you acquainted
with one another, and then you can ask
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“All right, then; I will. I suppose
Mrs. Leach is going abroad with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no!” she replied, with
unusual emphasis.</p>

<p>“Then she is not living here <i>altogether</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! What an absurd idea!”</p>

<p>“She is a handsome woman for her
age, although she will never see fifty
again.”</p>

<p>“I think she will.”</p>

<p>“You mean that she will live to a
hundred?”</p>

<p>“No. I mean that she is not more
than thirty.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to be hanging since
she was fifty!”</p>

<p>“Every woman is the age she looks,”
said Miss West, sententiously.</p>

<p>“So be it; neither Mrs. Leach’s age
nor looks concern me. You and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
hit it off together pretty well, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she answered rather
loftily.</p>

<p>“Then that is all right!” in a tone
of brisk relief.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Miss West, excuse me, if I repeat
your own recent reply to me, you want
to know <i>too</i> much.”</p>

<p>“If you imply——” she began, but
hesitated, for at this instant the door was
opened by a footman, and Mr. West
entered, leaning on Mrs. Leach’s arm,
whilst his valet followed with a supply of
papers, rugs, and cushions. They formed
quite an interesting procession.</p>
